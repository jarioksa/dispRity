It allows users to summarise matrices as representations as multidimensional spaces into a single value or distribution describing a specific aspect of this multidimensional space (the disparity). Multidimensional spaces can be ordinated matrices from MDS, PCA, PCO, PCoA but the package is not restricted to any type of matrices! This manual is based on the version 1.1.0. 1.1 What is dispRity? This is a modular package for measuring disparity in R. It allows users to summarise ordinated matrices (e.g. MDS, PCA, PCO, PCoA) to perform some multidimensional analysis. Typically, these analysis are used in palaeobiology and evolutionary biology to study the changes in morphology through time. However, there are many more applications in ecology, evolution and beyond. 1.1.1 Modular? Because their exist a multitude of ways to measure disparity, each adapted to every specific question, this package uses an easy to modify modular architecture. In coding, each module is simply a function or a modification of a function that can be passed to the main functions of the package to tweak it to your proper needs! In practice, you will notice throughout this manual that some function can take other functions as arguments: the modular architecture of this package allows you to use any function for these arguments (with some restrictions explained for each specific cases). This will allow you to finely tune your multidimensional analysis to the needs of your specific question! 1.2 Installing and running the package You can install this package easily, directly from the CRAN: install.packages(&quot;dispRity&quot;) Alternatively, for the most up to data version and some functionalities not compatible with the CRAN, you can use the package through GitHub using devtool (see to CRAN or not to CRAN? for more details): ## Checking if devtools is already installed if(!require(devtools)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) ## Installing the latest released version directly from GitHub install_github(&quot;TGuillerme/dispRity&quot;, ref = &quot;release&quot;) Anyways to upload it, you can use Note this uses the release branch (1.1.0). For the piping-hot (but potentially unstable) version, you can change the argument ref = release to ref = master. dispRity depends mainly on the ape package and uses functions from several other packages (ade4, geometry, grDevices, hypervolume, paleotree, snow, Claddis, geomorph and RCurl). 1.3 To CRAN or not to CRAN? This package can be installed via the CRAN or via GitHub. The CRAN version is a more “strict” version of the package that does not include some functionalities (such as Claddis.ordination or this gitbook vignette) because of compatibility issues with the CRAN requirement. The GitHub version is a more “reactive” version (fed by user’s suggestions and comments) and can contain more functionalities (see list below). This version exists on a &quot;release&quot; branch which is tested as strictly as the CRAN version with Travis and codecov. The &quot;master&quot; branch contains always the latest “piping hot”, not yet release version. It might (though rarely) be bugged. Note however, that apart from the functions listed below, both versions of the package have the same tested and implemented functions. Functions not available on the CRAN version (1.0.3): Claddis.ordination 1.4 Help If you need help with the package, hopefully the following manual will be useful. However, parts of this package are still in development and some other parts are probably not covered. Thus if you have suggestions or comments on on what has already been developed or will be developed, please send me an email (guillert@tcd.ie) or if you are a GitHub user, directly create an issue on the GitHub page. 1.5 Citations To cite the package, this manual or some specific functionalities, you can use the following references: The package main paper: Guillerme T. dispRity: A modular R package for measuring disparity.

["glossary.html", "2 Glossary 2.1 Glossary equivalences in palaeobiology and ecology", " 2 Glossary Multidimensional space (or just space). The mathematical multidimensional object that will be analysed with this package. In morphometrics, this is often referred to as the morphospace. However it may also be referred to as the cladisto-space for cladistic data or the eco-space for ecological data etc. In practice, this term designates a matrix where the columns represent the dimensions of the space (often – but not necessarily - &gt; 3!) and the rows represent the elements within this space. Elements. The rows of the multidimensional space matrix. Elements can be taxa, field sites, countries etc. Dimensions. The columns of the multidimensional space matrix. The dimensions can be referred to as axes of variation, or principal components, for ordinated spaces obtained from a PCA for example. Subsets. Subsets of the multidimensional space. A subset (or subsets) contains the same number of dimensions as the space but may contain a smaller subset of elements. For example, if our space is composed of birds and mammals (the elements) and 50 principal components of variation (the dimensions), we can create two subsets containing just mammals or birds, but with the same 50 dimensions, to compare disparity in the two clades. Disparity. A metric expressing the similarities/dissimilarities of the elements within the space or a summarising the space dimensions. For example the pairwise distances between elements or the range of each dimensions. 2.1 Glossary equivalences in palaeobiology and ecology In this manual In dispRity E.g. in palaeobiology E.g. in ecology the multidimensional space a matrix object (\\(n\\times k\\)) a morphospace a function-space elements rows (\\(n\\)) taxa field experiments dimensions columns (\\(k\\)) morphological characters communities’ compositions subsets a matrix (\\(m \\times k\\), with \\(m \\leq n\\)) time series experimental treatments disparity a function sum of variances ellipsoid volume "],

Any matrix object in R. Disparity can be estimated from pretty much any matrix as long as rows represent the elements and columns the dimensions. These matrices can be observations, pairwise differences between elements, ordinations, etc… Note that whether the matrix is an ordinated one or of any other type, it is always considered as the multidimensional space to analysis and no corrections are applied to it (e.g. if ordinated and with negative eigen values, no correction is used). Always make sure the input is the right multidimensional space to analyse! 3.2 Ordinated matrices Classically, when a high number of variables is used, disparity is calculated from ordinated matrices. These can be any type of ordinations (PCO, PCA, PCoA, MDS, etc.) as long as elements are the rows (taxa, countries, field experiments) and the dimensions are the columns. 3.2.1 Ordination matrices from geomorph You can also easily use data from geomorph using the geomorph.ordination function. This function simply takes Procrustes aligned data and performs an ordination: require(geomorph) ## Loading the plethodon dataset data(plethodon) ## Performing a Procrustes transform on the landmarks procrustes &lt;- gpagen(plethodon$land, PrinAxes = FALSE, print.progress = FALSE) ## Ordinating this data geomorph.ordination(procrustes)[1:5,1:5] ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## [1,] -0.0369931363 0.05118247 -0.0016971082 -0.003128809 -0.010936371 ## [2,] -0.0007493738 0.05942082 0.0001371715 -0.002768680 -0.008117383 ## [3,] 0.0056004654 0.07419599 -0.0052612103 -0.005034566 -0.002746592 ## [4,] -0.0134808572 0.06463959 -0.0458436015 -0.007887369 0.009816827 ## [5,] -0.0334696244 0.06863518 0.0136292041 0.007359409 0.022347225 Options for the ordination (from ?prcomp) can be directly passed to this function to perform customised ordinations. Additionally you can give the function a geomorph.data.frame object. If the latter contains sorting information (i.e. factors), they can be directly used to make a customised dispRity object customised dispRity object! ## Using a geomorph.data.frame geomorph_df &lt;- geomorph.data.frame(procrustes, species = plethodon$species, site = plethodon$site) ## Ordinating this data and making a dispRity object geomorph.ordination(geomorph_df) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 4 customised subsets for 40 elements: ## species.Jord, species.Teyah, site.Allo, site.Symp. More about these dispRity objects below! 3.2.2 Ordination matrices from Claddis This functionality is not available on the CRAN version of the package (1.0.3) due to CRAN compatibility issues see to CRAN or not to CRAN? for more information and on how to install the GitHub (more complete) version of the package (1.1.0). dispRity package can easily take data from Claddis using the Claddis.ordination function. For this, simply input a matrix in the Claddis format to the function and it will automatically calculate and ordinate the distances among taxa: require(Claddis) ## Ordinating the example data from Claddis Claddis.ordination(Michaux1989) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## Ancilla 0.000000e+00 4.154578e-01 0.2534942 ## Turrancilla -5.106645e-01 1.956921e-16 -0.2534942 ## Ancillista 5.106645e-01 6.523071e-17 -0.2534942 ## Amalda -2.004476e-16 -4.154578e-01 0.2534942 Note that several options are available, namely which type of distance should be computed. See more info in the function manual (?Claddis.ordination). Alternatively, it is of course also possible to manual calculate the ordination matrix using the functions Claddis::MorphDistMatrix and stats::cmdscale. 3.2.3 Other kinds of ordination matrices If you are not using the packages mentioned above (Claddis and geomorph) you can easily make your own ordination matrices by using the following functions from the stats package. Here is how to do it for the following types of matrices: Multivariate matrices (principal components analysis; PCA) ## A multivariate matrix head(USArrests) ## Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape ## Alabama 13.2 236 58 21.2 ## Alaska 10.0 263 48 44.5 ## Arizona 8.1 294 80 31.0 ## Arkansas 8.8 190 50 19.5 ## California 9.0 276 91 40.6 ## Colorado 7.9 204 78 38.7 ## Ordinating the matrix using `prcomp` ordination &lt;- prcomp(USArrests) ## Selecting the ordinated matrix ordinated_matrix &lt;- ordination$x head(ordinated_matrix) ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 ## Alabama 64.80216 -11.448007 -2.4949328 -2.4079009 ## Alaska 92.82745 -17.982943 20.1265749 4.0940470 ## Arizona 124.06822 8.830403 -1.6874484 4.3536852 ## Arkansas 18.34004 -16.703911 0.2101894 0.5209936 ## California 107.42295 22.520070 6.7458730 2.8118259 ## Colorado 34.97599 13.719584 12.2793628 1.7214637 This results in a ordinated matrix with US states as elements and four dimensions (PC 1 to 4). For an alternative method, see the ?princomp function.

Of course any other method for creating the ordination matrix is totally valid, you can also not use any ordination at all! The only requirements for the dispRity functions is that the input is a matrix with elements as rows and dimensions as columns. 3.3 Performing a simple dispRity analysis Two dispRity functions allow users to run an analysis pipeline simply by inputting an ordination matrix. These functions allow users to either calculate the disparity through time (dispRity.through.time) or the disparity of user-defined groups (dispRity.per.group). IMPORTANT Note that disparity.through.time and disparity.per.group are wrapper functions (i.e. they incorporate lots of other functions) that allow users to run a basic disparity-through-time, or disparity among groups, analysis without too much effort. As such they use a lot of default options. These are described in the help files for the functions that are used to make the wrapper functions, and not described in the help files for disparity.through.time and disparity.per.group. These defaults are good enough for data exploration, but for a proper analysis you should consider the best parameters for your question and data. For example, which metric should you use? How many bootstraps do you require? What model of evolution is most appropriate if you are time slicing? Should you rarefy the data? See chrono.subsets, custom.subsets, boot.matrix and dispRity.metric for more details of the defaults used in each of these functions. Note that any of these default arguments can be changed within the disparity.through.time or disparity.per.group functions. 3.3.1 Example data To illustrate these functions, we will use data from Beck and Lee (2014). This dataset contains an ordinated matrix of 50 discrete characters from mammals (BeckLee_mat50), another matrix of the same 50 mammals and the estimated discrete data characters of their descendants (thus 50 + 49 rows, BeckLee_mat99), a dataframe containing the ages of each taxon in the dataset (BeckLee_ages) and finally a phylogenetic tree with the relationships among the 50 mammals (BeckLee_tree). ## Loading the ordinated matrices data(BeckLee_mat50) data(BeckLee_mat99) ## The first five taxa and dimensions of the 50 taxa matrix head(BeckLee_mat50[, 1:5]) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## Cimolestes -0.5319679 0.1117759259 0.09865194 -0.1933148 0.2035833 ## Maelestes -0.4087147 0.0139690317 0.26268300 0.2297096 0.1310953 ## Batodon -0.6923194 0.3308625215 -0.10175223 -0.1899656 0.1003108 ## Bulaklestes -0.6802291 -0.0134872777 0.11018009 -0.4103588 0.4326298 ## Daulestes -0.7386111 0.0009001369 0.12006449 -0.4978191 0.4741342 ## Uchkudukodon -0.5105254 -0.2420633915 0.44170317 -0.1172972 0.3602273 ## The first five taxa and dimensions of the 99 taxa + ancestors matrix BeckLee_mat99[c(1, 2, 98, 99), 1:5] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## Cimolestes -0.60824375 -0.0323683 0.08458885 -0.43384481 -0.30536875 ## Maelestes -0.57302058 -0.2840361 0.01308847 -0.12588477 0.06123611 ## n48 -0.05529018 0.4799330 0.04118477 0.04944912 -0.35588301 ## n49 -0.13067785 0.4478168 0.11956268 0.13800340 -0.32227852 ## Loading a list of first and last occurrence dates for the fossils data(BeckLee_ages) head(BeckLee_ages) ## FAD LAD ## Adapis 37.2 36.8 ## Asioryctes 83.6 72.1 ## Leptictis 33.9 33.3 ## Miacis 49.0 46.7 ## Mimotona 61.6 59.2 ## Notharctus 50.2 47.0 ## Loading and plotting the phylogeny data(BeckLee_tree) plot(BeckLee_tree, cex = 0.8) axisPhylo(root = 140) nodelabels(cex = 0.5) Of course you can use your own data as detailed in the previous chapter. 3.3.2 Disparity through time The dispRity.through.time function calculates disparity through time, a common analysis in palaeontology. This function (and the following one) uses an analysis pipeline with a lot of default parameters to make the analysis as simple as possible. Of course all the defaults can be changed if required, more on this later. For a disparity through time analysis, you will need: An ordinated matrix (we covered that above) A phylogenetic tree: this must be a phylo object (from the ape package) and needs a root.time element. To give your tree a root time (i.e. an age for the root), you can simply do\\ my_tree$root.time &lt;- my_age. The required number of time subsets (here time = 3) Your favourite disparity metric (here the sum of variances) Using the Beck and Lee (2014) data described above: ## Measuring disparity through time disparity_data &lt;- dispRity.through.time(BeckLee_mat50, BeckLee_tree, time = 3, metric = c(sum, variances)) This generates a dispRity object (see here for technical details). When displayed, these dispRity objects provide us with information on the operations done to the matrix: ## Print the disparity_data object disparity_data ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 discrete time subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## 133.51104 - 89.00736, 89.00736 - 44.50368, 44.50368 - 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Disparity was calculated as: metric. We asked for three subsets (evenly spread across the age of the tree), the data was bootstrapped 100 times (default) and the metric used was the sum of variances. We can now summarise or plot the disparity_data object, or perform statistical tests on it (e.g. a simple lm): ## Summarising disparity through time summary(disparity_data) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 133.51104 - 89.00736 5 1.575 1.305 0.729 1.118 1.420 1.509 ## 2 89.00736 - 44.50368 29 1.922 1.867 1.775 1.830 1.889 1.922 ## 3 44.50368 - 0 16 1.990 1.871 1.716 1.831 1.914 1.942 ## Plotting the results plot(disparity_data, type = &quot;continuous&quot;) ## Testing for an difference among the time bins disp_lm &lt;- test.dispRity(disparity_data, test = lm, comparisons = &quot;all&quot;) ## Warning in test.dispRity(disparity_data, test = lm, comparisons = &quot;all&quot;): Multiple p-values will be calculated without adjustment! ## This can inflate Type I error! summary(disp_lm) ## ## Call: ## test(formula = data ~ subsets, data = data) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -0.56623 -0.04160 0.01049 0.05507 0.31886 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

You can also directly explore the specific function help files within R and navigate to related functions. 3.3.3 Disparity among groups The dispRity.per.group function is used if you are interested in looking at disparity among groups rather than through time. For example, you could ask if there is a difference in disparity between two groups? To perform such an analysis, you will need: An matrix with rows as elements and columns as dimensions (always!) A list of group members: this list should be a list of numeric vectors or names corresponding to the row names in the matrix. For example list(&quot;a&quot; = c(1,2), &quot;b&quot; = c(3,4)) will create a group a containing elements 1 and 2 from the matrix and a group b containing elements 3 and 4. Note that elements can be present in multiple groups at once. Your favourite disparity metric (here the sum of variances) Using the Beck and Lee (2014) data described above: ## Creating the two groups (crown versus stem) as a list mammal_groups &lt;- crown.stem(BeckLee_tree, inc.nodes = FALSE) ## Measuring disparity for each group disparity_data &lt;- dispRity.per.group(BeckLee_mat50, group = mammal_groups, metric = c(sum, variances)) We can display the disparity of both groups by simply looking at the output variable (disparity_data) and then summarising the disparity_data object and plotting it, and/or by performing a statistical test to compare disparity across the groups (here a Wilcoxon test). ## Print the disparity_data object disparity_data ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 2 customised subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## crown, stem. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Disparity was calculated as: metric. ## Summarising disparity in the different groups summary(disparity_data) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 crown 30 1.995 1.933 1.883 1.917 1.951 1.983 ## 2 stem 20 1.715 1.635 1.535 1.610 1.664 1.691 ## Plotting the results plot(disparity_data) ## Testing for a difference between the groups test.dispRity(disparity_data, test = wilcox.test, details = TRUE) ## $`crown : stem` ## $`crown : stem`[[1]] ## ## Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction ## ## data: dots[[1L]][[1L]] and dots[[2L]][[1L]] ## W = 10000, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 References "],

If any of your questions are not covered in these sections, please refer to the function help files in R, send me an email (guillert@tcd.ie), or raise an issue on GitHub. The several tutorials below describe specific functionalities of certain functions; please always refer to the function help files for the full function documentation! Before each section, make sure you loaded the Beck and Lee (2014) data (see example data for more details). ## Loading the data data(BeckLee_mat50) data(BeckLee_mat99) data(BeckLee_tree) data(BeckLee_ages) 4.1 Time slicing The function chrono.subsets allows users to divide the matrix into different time subsets or slices given a dated phylogeny that contains all the elements (i.e. taxa) from the matrix. Each subset generated by this function will then contain all the elements present at a specific point in time or during a specific period in time. Two types of time subsets can be performed by using the method option: Discrete time subsets (or time-binning) using method = discrete Continuous time subsets (or time-slicing) using method = continuous For the time-slicing method details see T. Guillerme and Cooper (2018). For both methods, the function takes the time argument which can be a vector of numeric values for: Defining the boundaries of the time bins (when method = discrete) Defining the time slices (when method = continuous) Otherwise, the time argument can be set as a single numeric value for automatically generating a given number of equidistant time-bins/slices. Additionally, it is also possible to input a dataframe containing the first and last occurrence data (FAD/LAD) for taxa that span over a longer time than the given tips/nodes age, so taxa can appear in more than one time bin/slice. Here is an example for method = discrete: ## Generating three time bins containing the taxa present every 40 Ma chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat50, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;discrete&quot;, time = c(120, 80, 40, 0)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 discrete time subsets for 50 elements: ## 120 - 80, 80 - 40, 40 - 0. Note that we can also generate equivalent results by just telling the function that we want three time-bins as follow: ## Automatically generate three equal length bins: chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat50, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;discrete&quot;, time = 3) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 discrete time subsets for 50 elements: ## 133.51104 - 89.00736, 89.00736 - 44.50368, 44.50368 - 0. In this example, the taxa were split inside each time-bin according to their age. However, the taxa here are considered as single points in time. It is totally possible that some taxa could have had longer longevity and that they exist in multiple time bins. In this case, it is possible to include them in more than one bin by providing a table of first and last occurrence dates (FAD/LAD). This table should have the taxa names as row names and two columns for respectively the first and last occurrence age: ## Displaying the table of first and last occurrence dates for each taxa head(BeckLee_ages) ## FAD LAD ## Adapis 37.2 36.8 ## Asioryctes 83.6 72.1 ## Leptictis 33.9 33.3 ## Miacis 49.0 46.7 ## Mimotona 61.6 59.2 ## Notharctus 50.2 47.0 ## Generating time bins including taxa that might span between them chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat50, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;discrete&quot;, time = c(120, 80, 40, 0), FADLAD = BeckLee_ages) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 discrete time subsets for 50 elements: ## 120 - 80, 80 - 40, 40 - 0. When using this method, the oldest boundary of the first bin (or the first slice, see below) is automatically generated as the root age plus 1% of the tree length, as long as at least three elements/taxa are present at that point in time. The algorithm adds an extra 1% tree length until reaching the required minimum of three elements. It is also possible to include nodes in each bin by using inc.nodes = TRUE and providing a matrix that contains the ordinated distance among tips and nodes. For the time-slicing method (method = continuous), the idea is fairly similar. This option, however, requires a matrix that contains the ordinated distance among taxa and nodes and an extra argument describing the assumed evolutionary model (via the model argument). This model argument is used when the time slice occurs along a branch of the tree rather than on a tip or a node, meaning that a decision must be made about what the value for the branch should be. The model can be one of the following: Punctuated models acctran where the data chosen along the branch is always the one of the descendant deltran where the data chosen along the branch is always the one of the ancestor random where the data chosen along the branch is randomly chosen between the descendant or the ancestor proximity where the data chosen along the branch is either the descendant or the ancestor depending on branch length Gradual models equal.split where the data chosen along the branch is both the descendant and the ancestor with an even probability gradual.split where the data chosen along the branch is both the descendant and the ancestor with a probability depending on branch length Note that the four first models are a proxy for punctuated evolution: the selected data is always either the one of the descendant or the ancestor. In other words, changes along the branches always occur at either ends of it. The two last models are a proxy for gradual evolution: the data from both the descendant and the ancestor is used with an associate probability. These later models perform better when bootstrapped, effectively approximating the “intermediate” state between and the ancestor and the descendants. ## Generating four time slices every 40 million years under a model of proximity evolution chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat99, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;continuous&quot;, model = &quot;proximity&quot;, time = c(120, 80, 40, 0), FADLAD = BeckLee_ages) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 4 continuous (proximity) time subsets for 99 elements: ## 120, 80, 40, 0. ## Generating four time slices automatically chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat99, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;continuous&quot;, model = &quot;proximity&quot;, time = 4, FADLAD = BeckLee_ages) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 4 continuous (proximity) time subsets for 99 elements: ## 133.51104, 89.00736, 44.50368, 0. If you want to generate time subsets based on stratigraphy, the package proposes a useful functions to do it for you: get.bin.ages (check out the function’s manual in R)! 4.2 Customised subsets Another way of separating elements into different categories is to use customised subsets as briefly explained above. This function simply takes the list of elements to put in each group (whether they are the actual element names or their position in the matrix). ## Creating the two groups (crown and stems) mammal_groups &lt;- crown.stem(BeckLee_tree, inc.nodes = FALSE) ## Separating the dataset into two different groups custom.subsets(BeckLee_mat50, group = mammal_groups) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 2 customised subsets for 50 elements: ## crown, stem. Like in this example, you can use the utility function crown.stem that allows to automatically separate the crown and stems taxa given a phylogenetic tree. Also, elements can easily be assigned to different groups if necessary! ## Creating the three groups as a list weird_groups &lt;- list(&quot;even&quot; = seq(from = 1, to = 49, by = 2), &quot;odd&quot; = seq(from = 2, to = 50, by = 2), &quot;all&quot; = c(1:50)) The custom.subsets function can also take a phylogeny (as a phylo object) as an argument to create groups as clades: ## Creating groups as clades custom.subsets(BeckLee_mat50, group = BeckLee_tree) This automatically creates 49 (the number of nodes) groups containing between two and 50 (the number of tips) elements. 4.3 Bootstraps and rarefactions One important step in analysing ordinated matrices is to pseudo-replicate the data to see how robust the results are, and how sensitive they are to outliers in the dataset. This can be achieved using the function boot.matrix to bootstrap and/or rarefy the data. The default options will bootstrap the matrix 100 times without rarefaction using the “full” bootstrap method (see below): ## Default bootstrapping boot.matrix(data = BeckLee_mat50) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 48 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). The number of bootstrap replicates can be defined using the bootstraps option. The method can be modified by controlling which bootstrap algorithm to use through the boot.type argument. Currently two algorithms are implemented: full where the bootstrapping is entirely stochastic (n elements are replaced by any m elements drawn from the data) single where only one random element is replaced by one other random element for each pseudo-replicate ## Bootstrapping with the single bootstrap method boot.matrix(BeckLee_mat50, boot.type = &quot;single&quot;) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 48 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;single&quot;). This function also allows users to rarefy the data using the rarefaction argument. Rarefaction allows users to limit the number of elements to be drawn at each bootstrap replication. This is useful if, for example, one is interested in looking at the effect of reducing the number of elements on the results of an analysis. This can be achieved by using the rarefaction option that draws only n-x at each bootstrap replicate (where x is the number of elements not sampled). The default argument is FALSE but it can be set to TRUE to fully rarefy the data (i.e. remove x elements for the number of pseudo-replicates, where x varies from the maximum number of elements present in each subset to a minimum of three elements). It can also be set to one or more numeric values to only rarefy to the corresponding number of elements. ## Bootstrapping with the full rarefaction boot.matrix(BeckLee_mat50, bootstraps = 20, rarefaction = TRUE) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 48 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 20 times (method:&quot;full&quot;) and fully rarefied. ## Or with a set number of rarefaction levels boot.matrix(BeckLee_mat50, bootstraps = 20, rarefaction = c(6:8, 3)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 48 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 20 times (method:&quot;full&quot;) and rarefied to 6, 7, 8, 3 elements. One other argument is dimensions that specifies how many dimensions from the matrix should be used for further analysis. When missing, all dimensions from the ordinated matrix are used. ## Using the first 50% of the dimensions boot.matrix(BeckLee_mat50, dimensions = 0.5) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 24 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Using the first 10 dimensions boot.matrix(BeckLee_mat50, dimensions = 10) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 10 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). It is also possible to specify the sampling probability in the bootstrap for each elements. This can be useful for weighting analysis for example (i.e. giving more importance to specific elements). These probabilities can be passed to the prob argument individually with a vector with the elements names or with a matrix with the rownames as elements names. The elements with no specified probability will be assigned a probability of 1 (or 1/maximum weight if the argument is weights rather than probabilities). ## Attributing a weight of 0 to Cimolestes and 10 to Maelestes boot.matrix(BeckLee_mat50, prob = c(&quot;Cimolestes&quot; = 0, &quot;Maelestes&quot; = 10)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 50 elements with 48 dimensions. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). Of course, one could directly supply the subsets generated above (using chrono.subsets or custom.subsets) to this function. ## Creating subsets of crown and stem mammals crown_stem &lt;- custom.subsets(BeckLee_mat50, group = list(&quot;crown&quot; = c(16, 19:41, 45:50), &quot;stem&quot; = c(1:15, 17:18, 42:44))) ## Bootstrapping and rarefying these groups boot.matrix(crown_stem, bootstraps = 200, rarefaction = TRUE) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 2 customised subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## crown, stem. ## Data was bootstrapped 200 times (method:&quot;full&quot;) and fully rarefied. ## Creating time slice subsets time_slices &lt;- chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat99, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;continuous&quot;, model = &quot;proximity&quot;, time = c(120, 80, 40, 0), FADLAD = BeckLee_ages) ## Bootstrapping the time slice subsets boot.matrix(time_slices, bootstraps = 100) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 4 continuous (proximity) time subsets for 99 elements with 97 dimensions: ## 120, 80, 40, 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). 4.4 Disparity metrics There are many ways of measuring disparity! In brief, disparity is a summary metric that will represent an aspect of an ordinated space (e.g. a MDS, PCA, PCO, PCoA). For example, one can look at ellipsoid hyper-volume of the ordinated space (Donohue et al. 2013), the sum and the product of the ranges and variances (Wills et al. 1994) or the median position of the elements relative to their centroid (Wills et al. 1994). Of course, there are many more examples of metrics one can use for describing some aspect of the ordinated space, with some performing better than other ones at particular descriptive tasks, and some being more generalist. Because of this great diversity of metrics, the package dispRity does not have one way to measure disparity but rather proposes to facilitate users in defining their own disparity metric that will best suit their particular analysis. In fact, the core function of the package, dispRity, allows the user to define any metric with the metric argument. However the metric argument has to follow certain rules: It must be composed from one to three function objects; The function(s) must take as a first argument a matrix or a vector; The function(s) must be of one of the three dimension-levels described below; At least one of the functions must be of dimension-level 1 or 2 (see below). 4.4.1 The function dimension-levels The metric function dimension-levels determine the “dimensionality of decomposition” of the input matrix. In other words, each dimension-level designates the dimensions of the output, i.e. either three (a matrix); two (a vector); or one (a single numeric value) dimension. Illustration of the different dimension-levels of functions with an input matrix 4.4.1.1 Dimension-level 1 functions A dimension-level 1 function will decompose a matrix or a vector into a single value: ## Creating a dummy matrix dummy_matrix &lt;- matrix(rnorm(12), 4, 3) ## Example of dimension-level 1 functions mean(dummy_matrix) ## [1] 0.4719271 median(dummy_matrix) ## [1] 0.4816107 Any summary metric such as mean or median are good examples of dimension-level 1 functions as they reduce the matrix to a single dimension (i.e. one value). 4.4.1.2 Dimension-level 2 functions A dimension-level 2 function will decompose a matrix into a vector. ## Defining the function as the product of rows prod.rows &lt;- function(matrix) apply(matrix, 1, prod) ## A dimension-level 2 metric prod.rows(dummy_matrix) ## [1] -0.1693259 0.1151639 0.4023232 0.2070852 Several dimension-level 2 functions are implemented in dispRity (see ?dispRity.metric) such as the variances or ranges functions that calculate the variance or the range of each dimension of the ordinated matrix respectively. 4.4.1.3 Dimension-level 3 functions Finally a dimension-level 3 function will transform the matrix into another matrix. Note that the dimension of the output matrix doesn’t need to match the the input matrix: ## A dimension-level 3 metric var(dummy_matrix) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0.2275789 0.2927228 0.2720648 ## [2,] 0.2927228 0.6394468 0.6796798 ## [3,] 0.2720648 0.6796798 1.9455929 ## A dimension-level 3 metric with a forced matrix output as.matrix(dist(dummy_matrix)) ## 1 2 3 4 ## 1 0.000000 2.284299 3.1469895 3.2820238 ## 2 2.284299 0.000000 1.8652681 1.9829745 ## 3 3.146990 1.865268 0.0000000 0.6684051 ## 4 3.282024 1.982975 0.6684051 0.0000000 4.4.2 make.metric Of course, functions can be more complex and involve multiple operations such as the centroids function (see ?dispRity.metric) that calculates the Euclidean distance between each element and the centroid of the ordinated space. The make.metric function implemented in dispRity is designed to help test and find the dimension-level of the functions. This function tests: If your function can deal with a matrix or a vector as an input; Your function’s dimension-level according to its output (dimension-level 1, 2 or 3, see above); Whether the function can be implemented in the dispRity function (the function is fed into a lapply loop). For example, let’s see if the functions described above are the right dimension-levels: ## Which dimension-level is the mean function? And can it be used in dispRity? make.metric(mean) ## mean outputs a single value. ## mean is detected as being a dimension-level 1 function. ## Which dimension-level is the prod.rows function? And can it be used in dispRity? make.metric(prod.rows) ## prod.rows outputs a matrix object. ## prod.rows is detected as being a dimension-level 2 function. ## Which dimension-level is the var function? And can it be used in dispRity? make.metric(var) ## var outputs a matrix object. ## var is detected as being a dimension-level 3 function. ## Additional dimension-level 2 and/or 1 function(s) will be needed. A non verbose version of the function is also available. This can be done using the option silent = TRUE and will simply output the dimension-level of the metric. ## Testing whether mean is dimension-level 1 if(make.metric(mean, silent = TRUE) != &quot;level1&quot;) { message(&quot;The metric is not dimension-level 1.&quot;) } ## Testing whether var is dimension-level 1 if(make.metric(var, silent = TRUE) != &quot;level1&quot;) { message(&quot;The metric is not dimension-level 1.&quot;) } ## The metric is not dimension-level 1. 4.4.3 Metrics in the dispRity function Using this metric structure, we can easily use any disparity metric in the dispRity function as follows: ## Measuring disparity as the standard deviation of all the values of the ## ordinated matrix (dimension-level 1 function). summary(dispRity(BeckLee_mat50, metric = sd)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 50 0.201 ## Measuring disparity as the standard deviation of the variance of each axis of ## the ordinated matrix (dimension-level 1 and 2 functions). summary(dispRity(BeckLee_mat50, metric = c(sd, variances))) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 50 0.028 ## Measuring disparity as the standard deviation of the variance of each axis of ## the variance covariance matrix (dimension-level 1, 2 and 3 functions). summary(dispRity(BeckLee_mat50, metric = c(sd, variances, var)), round = 10) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 50 0 Note that the order of each function in the metric argument does not matter, the dispRity function will automatically detect the function dimension-levels (using make.metric) and apply them to the data in decreasing order (dimension-level 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1). ## Disparity as the standard deviation of the variance of each axis of the ## variance covariance matrix: disparity1 &lt;- summary(dispRity(BeckLee_mat50, metric = c(sd, variances, var)), round = 10) ## Same as above but using a different function order for the metric argument disparity2 &lt;- summary(dispRity(BeckLee_mat50, metric = c(variances, sd, var)), round = 10) ## Both ways output the same disparity values: disparity1 == disparity2 ## subsets n obs ## [1,] TRUE TRUE TRUE In these examples, we considered disparity to be a single value. For example, in the previous example, we defined disparity as the standard deviation of the variances of each column of the variance/covariance matrix (metric = c(variances, sd, var)). It is, however, possible to calculate disparity as a distribution. 4.4.4 Metrics implemented in dispRity Several disparity metrics are implemented in the dispRity package. The detailed list can be found in ?dispRity.metric along with some description of each metric. Level Name Description Source 2 ancestral.dist The distance between an element and its ancestor dispRity 2 centroids1 The distance between each element and the centroid of the ordinated space dispRity 1 convhull.surface The surface of the convex hull formed by all the elements geometry::convhulln$area 1 convhull.volume The volume of the convex hull formed by all the elements geometry::convhulln$vol 1 diagonal The longest distance in the ordinated space (like the diagonal in two dimensions) dispRity 1 ellipse.volume1 The volume of the ellipsoid of the space Donohue et al. (2013) 1 mode.val The modal value dispRity 1 n.ball.volume The hyper-spherical (n-ball) volume dispRity 2 pairwise.dist The pairwise distances between elements vegan::vegist 2 radius The radius of each dimensions dispRity 2 ranges The range of each dimension dispRity 1 span.tree.length The minimal spanning tree length vegan::spantree 2 variances The variance of each dimension dispRity 1: Note that by default, the centroid is the centroid of the elements. It can, however, be fixed to a different value by using the centroid argument centroids(space, centroid = rep(0, ncol(space))), for example the origin of the ordinated space. 2: This function uses an estimation of the eigenvalue that only works for MDS or PCoA ordinations (not PCA). 4.4.5 Equations and implementations Some of the functions described below are implemented in the dispRity package and do not require any other packages to calculate (see implementation here). \\[\\begin{equation} ancestral.dist = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({k}_{n}-Ancestor_{n})^2}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} centroids = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({k}_{n}-Centroid_{k})^2}} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} diagonal = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}|max(k_i) - min(k_i)|} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} ellipse.volume = \\frac{\\pi^{k/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{k}{2}+1)}\\displaystyle\\prod_{i=1}^{k} (\\lambda_{i}^{0.5}) \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} n.ball.volume = \\frac{\\pi^{k/2}}{\\Gamma(\\frac{k}{2}+1)}\\displaystyle\\prod_{i=1}^{k} R \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} radius = |\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}k_i}{n} - f(\\mathbf{v}k)| \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} ranges = |max(k_i) - min(k_i)| \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} variances = \\sigma^{2}{k_i} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} span.tree.length = \\sum(\\mathrm{branch\\ length}) \\end{equation}\\] Where k is the number of dimensions, n the number of elements, \\(\\Gamma\\) is the Gamma distribution, \\(\\lambda_i\\) is the eigenvalue of each dimensions, \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) is their variance and \\(Centroid_{k}\\) is their mean, \\(Ancestor_{n}\\) is the coordinates of the ancestor of element \\(n\\), \\(f(\\mathbf{v}k)\\) is function to select one value from the vector \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) of the dimension \\(k\\) (e.g. it’s maximum, minimum, mean, etc.), R is the radius of the sphere or the product of the radii of each dimensions (\\(\\displaystyle\\prod_{i=1}^{k}R_{i}\\) - for a hyper-ellipsoid). 4.4.6 Using the different disparity metrics Here is a brief demonstration of the main metrics implemented in dispRity. First, we will create a dummy/simulated ordinated space using the space.maker utility function (more about that here: ## Creating a 10*5 normal space set.seed(1) dummy_space &lt;- space.maker(10, 5, rnorm) We will use this simulated space to demonstrate the different metrics. 4.4.6.1 Volumes and surface metrics The functions ellipse.volume, convhull.surface, convhull.volume and n.ball.volume all measure the surface or the volume of the ordinated space occupied: Because there is only one subset (i.e. one matrix) in the dispRity object, the operations below are the equivalent of metric(dummy_space) (with rounding). ## Calculating the ellipsoid volume summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = ellipse.volume)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 257.8 WARNING: in such dummy space, this gives the estimation of the ellipsoid volume, not the real ellipsoid volume! See the cautionary note in ?ellipse.volume. ## Calculating the convex hull surface summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = convhull.surface)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 11.91 ## Calculating the convex hull volume summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = convhull.volume)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 1.031 ## Calculating the convex hull volume summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = n.ball.volume)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 4.43 The convex hull based functions are a call to the geometry::convhulln function with the &quot;FA&quot; option (computes total area and volume). Also note that they are really sensitive to the size of the dataset. Cautionary note: measuring volumes in a high number of dimensions can be strongly affected by the curse of dimensionality that often results in near 0 disparity values. I strongly recommend reading this really intuitive explanation from Toph Tucker. 4.4.6.2 Ranges, variances, radius, pairwise distance, modal value and diagonal The functions ranges, variances radius, pairwise.dist, mode.val and diagonal all measure properties of the ordinated space based on its dimensional properties (they are also less affected by the “curse of dimensionality”): ranges, variances and radius work on the same principle and measure the range/variance/radius of each dimension: ## Calculating the ranges of each dimension in the ordinated space ranges(dummy_space) ## [1] 2.430909 3.726481 2.908329 2.735739 1.588603 ## Calculating disparity as the distribution of these ranges summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = ranges)) ## subsets n obs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 1 10 2.431 1.673 2.431 2.908 3.645 ## Calculating disparity as the sum and the product of these ranges summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = c(sum, ranges))) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 13.39 summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = c(prod, ranges))) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 114.5 ## Calculating the variances of each dimension in the ordinated space variances(dummy_space) ## [1] 0.6093144 1.1438620 0.9131859 0.6537768 0.3549372 ## Calculating disparity as the distribution of these variances summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = variances)) ## subsets n obs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 1 10 0.609 0.38 0.609 0.913 1.121 ## Calculating disparity as the sum and the product of these variances summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = c(sum, variances))) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 3.675 summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = c(prod, variances))) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 0.148 ## Calculating the radius of each dimension in the ordinated space radius(dummy_space) ## [1] 1.4630780 2.4635449 1.8556785 1.4977898 0.8416318 ## By default the radius is the maximum distance from the centre of ## the dimension.

The diagonal function measures the multidimensional diagonal of the whole space (i.e. in our case the longest Euclidean distance in our five dimensional space). The mode.val function measures the modal value of the matrix: ## Calculating the ordinated space&#39;s diagonal summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = diagonal)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 3.659 ## Calculating the modal value of the matrix summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = mode.val)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 -2.21 This metric is only a Euclidean diagonal (mathematically valid) if the dimensions within the space are all orthogonal! 4.4.6.3 Centroids and ancestral distance metrics The centroids metric allows users to measure the position of the different elements compared to a fixed point in the ordinated space. By default, this function measures the distance between each element and their centroid (centre point): ## The distribution of the distances between each element and their centroid summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = centroids)) ## subsets n obs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 1 10 2.214 0.788 1.267 1.993 3.167 ## Disparity as the median value of these distances summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = c(median, centroids))) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 1.435 It is however possible to fix the coordinates of the centroid to a specific point in the ordinated space, as long as it has the correct number of dimensions: ## The distance between each element and the origin of the ordinated space summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = centroids, centroid = c(0,0,0,0,0))) ## subsets n obs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 1 10 2.323 0.785 1.2 2.044 3.176 ## Disparity as the distance between each element and a specific point in space summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = centroids, centroid = c(0,1,2,3,4))) ## subsets n obs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 1 10 4.675 4.293 5.032 6.155 6.957 The ancestral.dist metric works on a similar principle as the centroids function but changes the centroid to be the coordinates of each element’s ancestor. Therefore this functions needs a tree and node coordinates as additional arguments: ## A generating a random tree with node labels tree &lt;- rtree(5) ; tree$node.label &lt;- paste0(&quot;n&quot;, 1:4) ## Adding the tip and node names to the matrix dummy_space2 &lt;- dummy_space[-1,] rownames(dummy_space2) &lt;- c(tree$tip.label, tree$node.label) ## Calculating all the ancestral nodes all_anc_centroids &lt;- nodes.coordinates(dummy_space2, tree, full = TRUE) ## Calculating the distances from the ancestral nodes ancestral_dist &lt;- dispRity(dummy_space2, metric = ancestral.dist, nodes.coords = all_anc_centroids) ## Warning in fun(matrix, ...): Missing tree and full argument for nodes.coordinates. ## See ?nodes.coordinates manual. ## The centroids function was applied instead. ## Calculating disparity as the sum of the distances from all the ancestral nodes summary(dispRity(ancestral_dist, metric = sum)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 9 36.56 4.4.6.4 Minimal spanning tree length The span.tree.length uses the vegan::spantree function to heuristically calculate the minimum spanning tree (the shortest multidimensional tree connecting each elements) and calculates its length as the sum of every branch lengths. ## The length of the minimal spanning tree summary(dispRity(dummy_space, metric = span.tree.length)) ## subsets n obs ## 1 1 10 15.4 Note that because the solution is heuristic, this metric can take a long time to compute for big matrices. 4.5 Summarising dispRity data (plots) Because of its architecture, printing dispRity objects only summarises their content but does not print the disparity value measured or associated analysis (more about this here). To actually see what is in a dispRity object, one can either use the summary function for visualising the data in a table or plot to have a graphical representation of the results. 4.5.1 Summarising dispRity data This function is an S3 function (summary.dispRity) allowing users to summarise the content of dispRity objects that contain disparity calculations. ## Example data from previous sections crown_stem &lt;- custom.subsets(BeckLee_mat50, group = list(&quot;crown&quot; = c(16, 19:41, 45:50), &quot;stem&quot; = c(1:15, 17:18, 42:44))) ## Bootstrapping and rarefying these groups boot_crown_stem &lt;- boot.matrix(crown_stem, bootstraps = 100, rarefaction = TRUE) ## Calculate disparity disparity_crown_stem &lt;- dispRity(boot_crown_stem, metric = c(sum, variances)) ## Creating time slice subsets time_slices &lt;- chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat99, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;continuous&quot;, model = &quot;proximity&quot;, time = c(120, 80, 40, 0), FADLAD = BeckLee_ages) ## Bootstrapping the time slice subsets boot_time_slices &lt;- boot.matrix(time_slices, bootstraps = 100) ## Calculate disparity disparity_time_slices &lt;- dispRity(boot_time_slices, metric = c(sum, variances)) ## Creating time bin subsets time_bins &lt;- chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat99, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;discrete&quot;, time = c(120, 80, 40, 0), FADLAD = BeckLee_ages, inc.nodes = TRUE) ## Bootstrapping the time bin subsets boot_time_bins &lt;- boot.matrix(time_bins, bootstraps = 100) ## Calculate disparity disparity_time_bins &lt;- dispRity(boot_time_bins, metric = c(sum, variances)) These objects are easy to summarise as follows: ## Default summary summary(disparity_time_slices) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 120 5 2.823 2.295 1.398 2.037 2.563 2.767 ## 2 80 19 3.233 3.065 2.785 2.973 3.133 3.266 ## 3 40 15 3.359 3.149 2.764 2.996 3.285 3.443 ## 4 0 10 4.055 3.685 3.169 3.453 3.760 3.961 Information about the number of elements in each subset and the observed (i.e. non-bootstrapped) disparity are also calculated. This is specifically handy when rarefying the data for example: head(summary(disparity_crown_stem)) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 crown 30 1.995 1.933 1.873 1.915 1.943 1.972 ## 2 crown 29 NA 1.935 1.861 1.906 1.953 1.976 ## 3 crown 28 NA 1.929 1.872 1.910 1.945 1.970 ## 4 crown 27 NA 1.933 1.852 1.905 1.947 1.981 ## 5 crown 26 NA 1.932 1.867 1.910 1.948 1.971 ## 6 crown 25 NA 1.929 1.847 1.913 1.949 1.975 The summary functions can also take various options such as: quantile values for the confidence interval levels (by default, the 50 and 95 quantiles are calculated) cent.tend for the central tendency to use for summarising the results (default is median) digitsoption corresponding to the number of decimal places to print (default is2`) recall option for printing the call of the dispRity object as well (default is FALSE) These options can easily be changed from the defaults as follows: ## Same as above but using the 88th quantile and the standard deviation as the summary summary(disparity_time_slices, quantile = 88, cent.tend = sd) ## subsets n obs bs.sd 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 120 5 2.823 0.380 1.398 2.037 2.563 2.767 ## 2 80 19 3.233 0.127 2.785 2.973 3.133 3.266 ## 3 40 15 3.359 0.189 2.764 2.996 3.285 3.443 ## 4 0 10 4.055 0.205 3.169 3.453 3.760 3.961 ## Printing the details of the object and digits the values to the 5th decimal place summary(disparity_time_slices, recall = TRUE, digits = 5) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 4 continuous (proximity) time subsets for 99 elements with 97 dimensions: ## 120, 80, 40, 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Disparity was calculated as: c(sum, variances). ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 120 5 2.82292 2.29516 1.39758 2.03734 2.56317 2.76690 ## 2 80 19 3.23312 3.06472 2.78542 2.97332 3.13308 3.26617 ## 3 40 15 3.35947 3.14918 2.76395 2.99563 3.28541 3.44267 ## 4 0 10 4.05457 3.68545 3.16864 3.45263 3.76034 3.96114 Note that the summary table is a data.frame, hence it is as easy to modify as any dataframe using dplyr. You can also export it in csv format using write.csv or write_csv or even directly export into LaTeX format using the following; ## Loading the xtable package require(xtable) ## Converting the table in LaTeX xtable(summary(disparity_time_slices)) 4.5.2 Plotting dispRity data An alternative (and more fun!) way to display the calculated disparity is to plot the results using the S3 method plot.dispRity. This function takes the same options as summary.dispRity along with various graphical options described in the function help files (see ?plot.dispRity). The plots can be of four different types: continuous for displaying continuous disparity curves box, lines, and polygons to display discrete disparity results in respectively a boxplot, confidence interval lines, and confidence interval polygons. This argument can be left empty. In this case, the algorithm will automatically detect the type of subsets from the dispRity object and plot accordingly. It is also possible to display the number of elements in each subset (as a horizontal dotted line) using the option elements = TRUE. Additionally, when the data is rarefied, one can indicate which level of rarefaction to display (i.e. only display the results for a certain number of elements) by using the rarefaction argument. ## Graphical parameters op &lt;- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting continuous disparity results plot(disparity_time_slices, type = &quot;continuous&quot;) ## Plotting discrete disparity results plot(disparity_crown_stem, type = &quot;box&quot;) ## As above but using lines for the rarefaction level of 20 elements only plot(disparity_crown_stem, type = &quot;line&quot;, rarefaction = 20) ## As above but using polygons while also displaying the number of elements plot(disparity_crown_stem, type = &quot;polygon&quot;, elements = TRUE) ## Resetting graphical parameters par(op) Since plot.dispRity uses the arguments from the generic plot method, it is of course possible to change pretty much everything using the regular plot arguments: ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the results with some classic options from plot plot(disparity_time_slices, col = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), ylab = c(&quot;Some measurement&quot;), xlab = &quot;Some other measurement&quot;, main = &quot;Many options...&quot;, ylim = c(5, 0), xlim = c(4, 0)) ## Adding a legend legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;Central tendency&quot;, &quot;Confidence interval 1&quot;, &quot;Confidence interval 2&quot;), col = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;green&quot;), pch = 19) ## Resetting graphical parameters par(op) In addition to the classic plot arguments, the function can also take arguments that are specific to plot.dispRity like adding the number of elements or rarefaction level (as described above), and also changing the values of the quantiles to plot as well as the central tendency. ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the results with some plot.dispRity arguments plot(disparity_time_slices, quantile = c(seq(from = 10, to = 100, by = 10)), cent.tend = sd, type = &quot;c&quot;, elements = TRUE, col = c(&quot;black&quot;, rainbow(10)), ylab = c(&quot;Disparity&quot;, &quot;Diversity&quot;), chrono.subsets = FALSE, xlab = &quot;Time (in in units from past to present)&quot;, observed = TRUE, main = &quot;Many more options...&quot;) ## Warning in plot.window(...): &quot;quantile&quot; is not a graphical parameter ## Warning in plot.xy(xy, type, ...): &quot;quantile&quot; is not a graphical parameter ## Warning in axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...): &quot;quantile&quot; is ## not a graphical parameter ## Warning in axis(side = side, at = at, labels = labels, ...): &quot;quantile&quot; is ## not a graphical parameter ## Warning in box(...): &quot;quantile&quot; is not a graphical parameter ## Warning in title(...): &quot;quantile&quot; is not a graphical parameter ## Resetting graphical parameters par(op) Note that the argument observed = TRUE allows to plot the disparity values calculated from the non-bootstrapped data as crosses on the plot. For comparing results, it is also possible to add a plot to the existent plot by using add = TRUE: ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the continuous disparity with a fixed y axis plot(disparity_time_slices, ylim = c(1, 4)) ## Adding the discrete data plot(disparity_time_bins, type = &quot;line&quot;, ylim = c(1, 4), xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, add = TRUE) ## Resetting graphical parameters par(op) Finally, if your data has been fully rarefied, it is also possible to easily look at rarefaction curves by using the rarefaction = TRUE argument: ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the rarefaction curves plot(disparity_crown_stem, rarefaction = TRUE) ## Resetting graphical parameters par(op) 4.6 Testing disparity hypotheses The dispRity package allows users to apply statistical tests to the calculated disparity to test various hypotheses. The function test.dispRity works in a similar way to the dispRity function: it takes a dispRity object, a test and a comparisons argument. The comparisons argument indicates the way the test should be applied to the data: pairwise (default): to compare each subset in a pairwise manner referential: to compare each subset to the first subset sequential: to compare each subset to the following subset all: to compare all the subsets together (like in analysis of variance) It is also possible to input a list of pairs of numeric values or characters matching the subset names to create personalised tests. Some other tests implemented in dispRity such as the dispRity::null.test have a specific way they are applied to the data and therefore ignore the comparisons argument. The test argument can be any statistical or non-statistical test to apply to the disparity object. It can be a common statistical test function (e.g. stats::t.test), a function implemented in dispRity (e.g. see ?null.test) or any function defined by the user. This function also allows users to correct for Type I error inflation (false positives) when using multiple comparisons via the correction argument. This argument can be empty (no correction applied) or can contain one of the corrections from the stats::p.adjust function (see ?p.adjust). Note that the test.dispRity algorithm deals with some classical test outputs and summarises the test output. It is, however, possible to get the full detailed output by using the options details = TRUE. Here we are using the variables generated in the section above: ## T-test to test for a difference in disparity between crown and stem mammals test.dispRity(disparity_crown_stem, test = t.test) ## [[1]] ## statistic: t ## crown : stem 66.67693 ## ## [[2]] ## parameter: df ## crown : stem 169.1446 ## ## [[3]] ## p.value ## crown : stem 2.275095e-123 ## Performing the same test but with the detailed t.test output test.dispRity(disparity_crown_stem, test = t.test, details = TRUE) ## $`crown : stem` ## $`crown : stem`[[1]] ## ## Welch Two Sample t-test ## ## data: dots[[1L]][[1L]] and dots[[2L]][[1L]] ## t = 66.677, df = 169.14, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2894967 0.3071619 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 1.928128 1.629799 ## Wilcoxon test applied to time sliced disparity with sequential comparisons, ## with Bonferroni correction test.dispRity(disparity_time_slices, test = wilcox.test, comparisons = &quot;sequential&quot;, correction = &quot;bonferroni&quot;) ## [[1]] ## statistic: W ## 120 : 80 27 ## 80 : 40 3466 ## 40 : 0 455 ## ## [[2]] ## p.value ## 120 : 80 1.720545e-33 ## 80 : 40 5.370214e-04 ## 40 : 0 3.599349e-28 ## Measuring the overlap between distributions in the time bins (using the ## implemented Bhattacharyya Coefficient function - see ?bhatt.coeff) test.dispRity(disparity_time_bins, test = bhatt.coeff) ## Warning in test.dispRity(disparity_time_bins, test = bhatt.coeff): Multiple p-values will be calculated without adjustment! ## This can inflate Type I error! ## bhatt.coeff ## 120 - 80 : 80 - 40 0.000000 ## 120 - 80 : 40 - 0 0.000000 ## 80 - 40 : 40 - 0 0.490448 Because of the modular design of the package, tests can always be made by the user (the same way disparity metrics can be user made). The only condition is that the test can be applied to at least two distributions. In practice, the test.dispRity function will pass the calculated disparity data (distributions) to the provided function in either pairs of distributions (if the comparisons argument is set to pairwise, referential or sequential) or a table containing all the distributions (comparisons = all; this should be in the same format as data passed to lm-type functions for example). 4.6.1 NPMANOVA in dispRity One often useful test to apply to multidimensional data is the permutational multivariate analysis of variance based on distance matrices vegan::adonis. This can be done on dispRity objects using the adonis.dispRity wrapper function. Basically, this function takes the exact same arguments as adonis and a dispRity object for data and performs a PERMANOVA based on the distance matrix of the multidimensional space (unless the multidimensional space was already defined as a distance matrix). The adonis.dispRity function uses the information from the dispRity object to generate default formulas: If the object contains customised subsets, it applies the default formula matrix ~ group testing the effect of group as a predictor on matrix (called from the dispRity object as data$matrix see dispRitu object details) If the object contains time subsets, it applies the default formula matrix ~ time testing the effect of time as a predictor (were the different levels of time are the different time slices/bins) set.seed(1) ## Generating a random character matrix character_matrix &lt;- sim.morpho(rtree(20), 50, rates = c(rnorm, 1, 0)) ## Calculating the distance matrix distance_matrix &lt;- as.matrix(dist(character_matrix)) ## Creating two groups random_groups &lt;- list(&quot;group1&quot; = 1:10, &quot;group2&quot; = 11:20) ## Generating a dispRity object random_disparity &lt;- custom.subsets(distance_matrix, random_groups) ## Running a default NPMANOVA adonis.dispRity(random_disparity) ## ## Call: ## vegan::adonis(formula = matrix ~ group, data = random_disparity, method = &quot;euclidean&quot;) ## ## Permutation: free ## Number of permutations: 999 ## ## Terms added sequentially (first to last) ## ## Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(&gt;F) ## group 1 16.5 16.500 1.3904 0.07171 0.095 . ## Residuals 18 213.6 11.867 0.92829 ## Total 19 230.1 1.00000 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Of course, it is possible to pass customised formulas if the disparity object contains more more groups.

The dispRity package proposes a wrapper function for geiger::dtt, dtt.dispRity that allows the use of any disparity metric. Unfortunately, this implementation is slower that geiger::dtt (so if you’re using the metrics implemented in geiger prefer the original version) and, as the original function, is limited to ultrametric trees (only living taxa!)… require(geiger) ## Loading required package: geiger geiger_data &lt;- get(data(geospiza)) ## Calculate the disparity of the dataset using the sum of variance dispRity_dtt &lt;- dtt.dispRity(data = geiger_data$dat, metric = c(sum, variances), tree = geiger_data$phy, nsim = 100) ## Warning in dtt.dispRity(data = geiger_data$dat, metric = c(sum, ## variances), : The following tip(s) was not present in the data: olivacea. ## Plotting the results plot(dispRity_dtt, fig.width=8, fig.height=8) Note that, like in the original dtt function, it is possible to change the evolutionary model (see ?geiger::sim.char documentation). 4.6.3 null morphospace testing with null.test This test is equivalent to the test performed in Díaz et al. (2016). It compares the disparity measured in the observed space to the disparity measured in a set of simulated spaces. These simulated spaces can be built with based on the hypothesis assumptions: for example, we can test whether our space is normal. set.seed(123) ## A &quot;normal&quot; multidimensional space with 50 dimensions and 10 elements normal_space &lt;- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 50) ## Calculating the disparity as the average pairwise distances obs_disparity &lt;- dispRity(normal_space, metric = c(mean, pairwise.dist)) ## Testing against 100 randomly generated normal spaces (results &lt;- null.test(obs_disparity, replicates = 100, null.distrib = rnorm)) ## Monte-Carlo test ## Call: [1] &quot;dispRity::null.test&quot; ## ## Observation: 9.910536 ## ## Based on 100 replicates ## Simulated p-value: 0.7524752 ## Alternative hypothesis: two-sided ## ## Std.Obs Expectation Variance ## -0.24885893 9.96420000 0.04650127 Here the results show that disparity measured in our observed space is not significantly different than the one measured in a normal space. We can then propose that our observed space is normal! These results have an attributed dispRity and randtest class and can be plotted as randtest objects using the dispRity S3 plot method: ## Plotting the results plot(results, main = &quot;Is this space normal?&quot;) For more details on generating spaces see the space.maker function tutorial. 4.6.4 Disparity model fitting with model.test [The model.test does blabalbalb] First let’s create a fine scaled disparity through time dataset: data(BeckLee_mat99) data(BeckLee_tree) ## Making a time slicing analysis every million years slice120 &lt;- chrono.subsets(BeckLee_mat99, BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;continuous&quot;, model = &quot;proximity&quot;, time = seq(from = 0, to = 120, by = 1)) ## Calculating disparity as the sum of variance on the bootstrapped data disparity_data &lt;- dispRity(boot.matrix(slice120), metric = c(sum, variances)) We can then check which mode of changes of disparity-through-time best fits the observed data. Here we are going to tests 7 different models: A simple Brownian Motion (“BM”) A simple Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (“OU”) An early burst model (“EB”) which is a rapid increase in variance followed by an OU model A multiple OU model (“multi.OU”) which is an OU model but with varying alpha parameters (the sometimes called “selection” parameter) An OU model followed by a Trend model (the Trend model is an OU model with increasing mean through time) A Trend model followed by an OU model. Note that the models can be any combination of the based implemented models which are &quot;BM&quot;, &quot;OU&quot;, &quot;EB&quot; and &quot;Trend&quot;. For example, one could test a model c(&quot;EB&quot;, &quot;Trend&quot;, &quot;OU&quot;, &quot;BM&quot;, &quot;OU&quot;, &quot;BM&quot;) for a (weird) model with an early burst, followed by a trend and a cycle of variance constrain (the OU parts) and releases (the BM parts). ## The list of models to test models_to_test &lt;- list(&quot;BM&quot;, &quot;OU&quot;, &quot;EB&quot;, &quot;multi.OU&quot;, &quot;Trend&quot;, c(&quot;OU&quot;, &quot;Trend&quot;), c(&quot;Trend&quot;, &quot;OU&quot;)) ## Testing all the models on the observed data (with fixed optima) model_test_output &lt;- model.test(disparity_data, models_to_test, time.split = 66, fixed.optima = TRUE) ## Evidence of equal variance (Bartlett&#39;s test of equal variances p = 0). ## Variance is not pooled. ## Running BM model...Done.

We could maybe repeat this with x1000 or x10000 for publication # table(rownames(five.models)[apply(five.models, 2, which.min)]) 4.7 Disparity as a distribution Disparity is often regarded as a summary value of the position of the all elements in the ordinated space. For example, the sum of variances, the product of ranges or the median distance between the elements and their centroid will summarise disparity as a single value. This value can be pseudo-replicated (bootstrapped) to obtain a distribution of the summary metric with estimated error. However, another way to perform disparity analysis is to use the whole distribution rather than just a summary metric (e.g. the variances or the ranges). This is possible in the dispRity package by calculating disparity as a dimension-level 2 metric only! Let’s have a look using our previous example of bootstrapped time slices but by measuring the distances between each taxon and their centroid as disparity. ## Measuring disparity as a whole distribution disparity_centroids &lt;- dispRity(boot_time_slices, metric = centroids) The resulting disparity object is of dimension-level 2, so it can easily be transformed into a dimension-level 1 object by, for example, measuring the median distance of all these distributions: ## Measuring median disparity in each time slice disparity_centroids_median &lt;- dispRity(disparity_centroids, metric = median) And we can now compare the differences between these methods: ## Summarising both disparity measurements: ## The distributions: summary(disparity_centroids) ## subsets n obs.median bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 120 5 1.539 1.287 0.536 1.092 1.553 1.864 ## 2 80 19 1.846 1.688 1.409 1.582 1.814 1.945 ## 3 40 15 1.892 1.685 1.327 1.563 1.839 2.062 ## 4 0 10 1.855 1.801 1.313 1.680 1.962 2.104 ## The summary of the distributions (as median) summary(disparity_centroids_median) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 120 5 1.508 1.287 0.535 0.943 1.477 1.508 ## 2 80 19 1.790 1.682 1.534 1.645 1.716 1.791 ## 3 40 15 1.689 1.678 1.552 1.635 1.717 1.822 ## 4 0 10 1.910 1.804 1.577 1.761 1.855 1.909 We can see that the summary message for the distribution is slightly different than before. Here summary also displays the observed central tendency (i.e. the central tendency of the measured distributions). Note that, as expected, this central tendency is the same in both metrics! Another, maybe more intuitive way, to compare both approaches for measuring disparity is to plot the distributions: ## Graphical parameters op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;, mfrow = c(1, 2)) ## Plotting both disparity measurements plot(disparity_centroids, ylab = &quot;Distribution of all the distances&quot;) plot(disparity_centroids_median, ylab = &quot;Distribution of the medians of all the distances&quot;) par(op) We can then test for differences in the resulting distributions using test.dispRity and the bhatt.coeff test as described above. ## Probability of overlap in the distribution of medians test.dispRity(disparity_centroids_median, test = bhatt.coeff) ## Warning in test.dispRity(disparity_centroids_median, test = bhatt.coeff): Multiple p-values will be calculated without adjustment! ## This can inflate Type I error! ## bhatt.coeff ## 120 : 80 0.1905968 ## 120 : 40 0.1936492 ## 120 : 0 0.1381682 ## 80 : 40 0.9416139 ## 80 : 0 0.6076888 ## 40 : 0 0.7124871 In this case, we are looking at the probability of overlap of the distribution of median distances from centroids among each pair of time slices. In other words, we are measuring whether the medians from each bootstrap pseudo-replicate for each time slice overlap. But of course, we might be interested in the actual distribution of the distances from the centroid rather than simply their central tendencies. This can be problematic depending on the research question asked since we are effectively comparing non-independent medians distributions (because of the pseudo-replication). One solution, therefore, is to look at the full distribution: ## Probability of overlap for the full distributions test.dispRity(disparity_centroids, test = bhatt.coeff) ## Warning in test.dispRity(disparity_centroids, test = bhatt.coeff): Multiple p-values will be calculated without adjustment! ## This can inflate Type I error! ## bhatt.coeff ## 120 : 80 0.6286805 ## 120 : 40 0.6631398 ## 120 : 0 0.5819930 ## 80 : 40 0.9397416 ## 80 : 0 0.8578102 ## 40 : 0 0.9361860 These results show the actual overlap among all the measured distances from centroids concatenated across all the bootstraps. For example, when comparing the slices 120 and 80, we are effectively comparing the 5 \\(\\times\\) 100 distances (the distances of the five elements in slice 120 bootstrapped 100 times) to the 19 \\(\\times\\) 100 distances from slice 80. However, this can also be problematic for some specific tests since the n \\(\\times\\) 100 distances are also pseudo-replicates and thus are still not independent. A second solution is to compare the distributions to each other for each replicate: ## Boostrapped probability of overlap for the full distributions test.dispRity(disparity_centroids, test = bhatt.coeff, concatenate = FALSE) ## Warning in test.dispRity(disparity_centroids, test = bhatt.coeff, concatenate = FALSE): Multiple p-values will be calculated without adjustment! ## This can inflate Type I error! ## bhatt.coeff 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 120 : 80 0.2507287 0.0000000 0.1450953 0.3829003 0.5431424 ## 120 : 40 0.3184407 0.0000000 0.2000000 0.4312174 0.7651213 ## 120 : 0 0.2368001 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.3464102 0.5791641 ## 80 : 40 0.5739203 0.2252672 0.4678055 0.6965587 0.8184853 ## 80 : 0 0.4649973 0.1382736 0.3688643 0.5757552 0.7292754 ## 40 : 0 0.5418625 0.1954287 0.4385665 0.6767986 0.8082483 These results show the median overlap among pairs of distributions in the first column (bhatt.coeff) and then the distribution of these overlaps among each pair of bootstraps. In other words, when two distributions are compared, they are now compared for each bootstrap pseudo-replicate, thus effectively creating a distribution of probabilities of overlap. For example, when comparing the slices 120 and 80, we have a mean probability of overlap of 0.28 and a probability between 0.18 and 0.43 in 50% of the pseudo-replicates. Note that the quantiles and central tendencies can be modified via the conc.quantiles option. 4.8 Disparity from other matrices In the example so far, disparity was measured from an ordinated multidimensional space (i.e. a PCO of the distances between taxa based on discrete morphological characters). This is a common approach in palaeobiology, morphometrics or ecology but ordinated matrices are not mandatory for the dispRity package! It is totally possible to perform the same analysis detailed above using other types of matrices as long as your elements are rows in your matrix. For example, we can use the data set eurodist, an R inbuilt dataset that contains the distances (in km) between European cities. We can check for example, if Northern European cities are closer to each other than Southern ones: ## Making the eurodist data set into a matrix (rather than &quot;dist&quot; object) eurodist &lt;- as.matrix(eurodist) eurodist[1:5, 1:5] ## Athens Barcelona Brussels Calais Cherbourg ## Athens 0 3313 2963 3175 3339 ## Barcelona 3313 0 1318 1326 1294 ## Brussels 2963 1318 0 204 583 ## Calais 3175 1326 204 0 460 ## Cherbourg 3339 1294 583 460 0 ## The two groups of cities Northern &lt;- c(&quot;Brussels&quot;, &quot;Calais&quot;, &quot;Cherbourg&quot;, &quot;Cologne&quot;, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, &quot;Hamburg&quot;, &quot;Hook of Holland&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;Stockholm&quot;) Southern &lt;- c(&quot;Athens&quot;, &quot;Barcelona&quot;, &quot;Geneva&quot;, &quot;Gibraltar&quot;, &quot;Lisbon&quot;, &quot;Lyons&quot;, &quot;Madrid&quot;, &quot;Marseilles&quot;, &quot;Milan&quot;, &quot;Munich&quot;, &quot;Rome&quot;, &quot;Vienna&quot;) ## Creating the subset dispRity object eurodist_subsets &lt;- custom.subsets(eurodist, group = list(&quot;Northern&quot; = Northern, &quot;Southern&quot; = Southern)) ## Bootstrapping and rarefying to 9 elements (the number of Northern cities) eurodist_bs &lt;- boot.matrix(eurodist_subsets, rarefaction = 9) ## Measuring disparity as the median distance from group&#39;s centroid euro_disp &lt;- dispRity(eurodist_bs, metric = c(median, centroids)) ## Testing the differences using a simple wilcox.test euro_diff &lt;- test.dispRity(euro_disp, test = wilcox.test) euro_diff_rar &lt;- test.dispRity(euro_disp, test = wilcox.test, rarefaction = 9) We can compare this approach to an ordination one: ## Ordinating the eurodist matrix euro_ord &lt;- cmdscale(eurodist, k = nrow(eurodist) - 2) ## Warning in cmdscale(eurodist, k = nrow(eurodist) - 2): only 11 of the first ## 19 eigenvalues are &gt; 0 ## Calculating disparity on the bootstrapped and rarefied subset data euro_ord_disp &lt;- dispRity(boot.matrix(custom.subsets(euro_ord, group = list(&quot;Northern&quot; = Northern, &quot;Southern&quot; = Southern)), rarefaction = 9), metric = c(median, centroids)) ## Testing the differences using a simple wilcox.test euro_ord_diff &lt;- test.dispRity(euro_ord_disp, test = wilcox.test) euro_ord_diff_rar &lt;- test.dispRity(euro_ord_disp, test = wilcox.test, rarefaction = 9) And visualise the differences: ## Plotting the differences par(mfrow = c(2,2), bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the normal disparity plot(euro_disp, main = &quot;Distance differences&quot;) ## Adding the p-value text(1.5, 4000, paste0(&quot;p=&quot;,round(euro_diff[[2]][[1]], digit = 5))) ## Plotting the rarefied disparity plot(euro_disp, rarefaction = 9, main = &quot;Distance differences (rarefied)&quot;) ## Adding the p-value text(1.5, 4000, paste0(&quot;p=&quot;,round(euro_diff_rar[[2]][[1]], digit = 5))) ## Plotting the ordinated disparity plot(euro_ord_disp, main = &quot;Ordinated differences&quot;) ## Adding the p-value text(1.5, 1400, paste0(&quot;p=&quot;,round(euro_ord_diff[[2]][[1]], digit = 5) )) ## Plotting the rarefied disparity plot(euro_ord_disp, rarefaction = 9, main = &quot;Ordinated differences (rarefied)&quot;) ## Adding the p-value text(1.5, 1400, paste0(&quot;p=&quot;,round(euro_ord_diff_rar[[2]][[1]], digit = 5) )) As expected, the results are pretty similar in pattern but different in terms of scale. The median centroids distance is expressed in km in the “Distance differences” plots and in Euclidean units of variation in the “Ordinated differences” plots. References "],

The dispRity package also offers some advanced data simulation features to allow to test hypothesis, explore multidimensional spaces, metrics properties or simply playing around with data! All the following functions are based on the same modular architecture of the package and therefore can be used with most of the functions of the package. 5.1 Simulating discrete morphological data The function sim.morpho allows to simulate discrete morphological data matrices (sometimes referred to as “cladistic” matrices). It allows to evolve multiple discrete characters on a given phylogenetic tree, given different evolutionary models, rates, and states. It even allows to include proper inapplicable data to make datasets as messy as in real life! In brief, the function sim.morpho takes a phylogenetic tree, the number of required characters, the evolutionary model and a function from which to draw the rates. The package also contains a function for quickly checking the matrix’s phylogenetic signal (as defined in systematics not phylogenetic comparative methods) using parsimony. The methods are described in details below set.seed(3) ## Simulating a starting tree with 15 taxa as a random coalescent tree my_tree &lt;- rcoal(15) ## Generating a matrix with 100 characters (85% binary and 15% three state) and ## an equal rates model with a gamma rate distribution (0.5, 1) with no ## invariant characters. my_matrix &lt;- sim.morpho(tree = my_tree, characters = 100, states = c(0.85, 0.15), rates = c(rgamma, shape = 0.5, rate = 1), invariant = FALSE) ## The first few lines of the matrix my_matrix[1:10, 1:10] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] ## t15 &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t12 &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t14 &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t6 &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t3 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t2 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t11 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## t7 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t1 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t5 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## Checking the matrix properties with a quick Maximum Parsimony tree search check.morpho(my_matrix, my_tree) ## ## Maximum parsimony 139.0000000 ## Consistency index 0.7625899 ## Retention index 0.8881356 ## Robinson-Foulds distance 0.0000000 Note that this example produces a tree with a great consistency index and an identical topology to the random coalescent tree! 5.1.1 A more detailed description The protocol implemented here to generate discrete morphological matrices is based on the ones developed in Thomas Guillerme and Cooper (2016) OReilly et al. (2016) M. N. Puttick et al. (2017) and O’Reilly et al. (2017). The first tree argument will be the tree on which to “evolve” the characters and therefore requires branch length. You can generate quick and easy random Yule trees using ape::rtree(number_of_taxa) but I would advise to use more realistic trees for more realistic simulations based on more realistic models (really realistic then) using the function tree.bd from the diversitree package (FitzJohn 2012) for example. The second argument, character is the number of characters. The third, states is the proportion of characters states above two. This argument intakes the proportion of n-states characters, for example states = c(0.5,0.3,0.2) will generate 50% of binary-state characters, 30% of three-state characters and 20% of four-state characters. There is no limit in the number of state characters proportion as long as the total makes up 100%. The fourth, model is the evolutionary model for generating the character(s). More about this below. The fifth and sixth, rates and substitution are the model parameters described below as well. Finally, the two logical arguments, are self explanatory: invariant whether to allow invariant characters (i.e. characters that don’t change) and verbose whether to print the simulation progress on your console. 5.1.1.1 Available evolutionary models There are currently three evolutionary models implemented in sim.morpho but more will come in the future. Note also that they allow fine tuning parameters making them pretty plastic! &quot;ER&quot;: this model allows any number of character states and is based on the Mk model (Lewis 2001). It assumes a unique overall evolutionary rate equal substitution rate between character states. This model is based on the ape::rTraitDisc function. &quot;HKY&quot;: this is binary state character model based on the molecular HKY model (Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano 1985). It uses the four molecular states (A,C,G,T) with a unique overall evolutionary rate and a biased substitution rate towards transitions (A &lt;-&gt; G or C &lt;-&gt; T) against transvertions (A &lt;-&gt; C and G &lt;-&gt; T). After evolving the nucleotides, this model transforms them into binary states by converting the purines (A and G) into state 0 and the pyrimidines (C and T) into state 1. This method is based on the phyclust::seq.gen.HKY function and was first proposed by OReilly et al. (2016). &quot;MIXED&quot;: this model uses a random (uniform) mix between both the &quot;ER&quot; and the &quot;HKY&quot; models. The models can take the following parameters: (1) rates is the evolutionary rate (i.e. the rate of changes along a branch; the evolutionary speed) and (2) substitution is the frequency of changes between one state or another. For example if a character can have high probability of changing (the evolutionary rate) with, each time a change occurs a probability of changing from state X to state Y (the substitution rate). Note that in the &quot;ER&quot; model, the substitution rate is ignore because by definition this rate is equal! The parameters arguments rates and substitution takes a distributions from which to draw the parameters values for each character. For example, if you want an &quot;HKY&quot; model with an evolutionary rate (i.e. speed) drawn from a uniform distribution bounded between 0.001 and 0.005, you can define it as rates = c(runif, min = 0.001, max = 0.005), runif being the function for random draws from a uniform distribution and max and min being the distribution parameters. These distributions should always be passed in the format c(random_distribution_function, distribution_parameters) with the names of the distribution parameters arguments. 5.1.1.2 Checking the results An additional function, check.morpho runs a quick Maximum Parsimony tree search using the phangorn parsimony algorithm. It quickly calculates the parsimony score, the consistency and retention indices and, if a tree is provided (e.g. the tree used to generate the matrix) it calculates the Robinson-Foulds distance between the most parsimonious tree and the provided tree to determine how different they are. 5.1.1.3 Adding inapplicable characters Once a matrix is generated, it is possible to apply inapplicable characters to it for increasing realism! Inapplicable characters are commonly designated as NA or simply -. They differ from missing characters ? in their nature by being inapplicable rather than unknown. For example, considering a binary character defined as “colour of the tail” with the following states “blue” and “red”; on a taxa with no tail, the character should be coded as inapplicable (“-”) since the state of the character “colour of tail” is known: it’s neither “blue” or “red”, it’s just not there! It contrasts with coding it as missing (“?” - also called as ambiguous) where the state is unknown, for example, the taxon of interest is a fossil where the tail has no colour preserved or is not present at all due to bad conservation! This type of characters can be added to the simulated matrices using the apply.NA function. It takes, as arguments, the matrix, the source of inapplicability (NAs - more below), the tree used to generate the matrix and the two same invariant and verbose arguments as defined above. The NAs argument allows two types of sources of inapplicability: &quot;character&quot; where the inapplicability is due to the character (e.g. coding a character tail for species with no tail). In practice, the algorithm chooses a character X as the underlying character (e.g. “presence and absence of tail”), arbitrarily chooses one of the states as “absent” (e.g. 0 = absent) and changes in the next character Y any state next to character X state 0 into an inapplicable token (“-”). This simulates the inapplicability induced by coding the characters (i.e. not always biological). &quot;clade&quot; where the inapplicability is due to evolutionary history (e.g. a clade loosing its tail). In practice, the algorithm chooses a random clade in the tree and a random character Z and replaces the state of the taxa present in the clade by the inapplicable token (“-”). This simulates the inapplicability induced by evolutionary biology (e.g. the lose of a feature in a clade). To apply these sources of inapplicability, simply repeat the number of inapplicable sources for the desired number of characters with inapplicable data. ## Generating 5 &quot;character&quot; NAs and 10 &quot;clade&quot; NAs my_matrix_NA &lt;- apply.NA(my_matrix, tree = my_tree, NAs = c(rep(&quot;character&quot;, 5), rep(&quot;clade&quot;, 10))) ## The first few lines of the resulting matrix my_matrix_NA[1:10, 90:100] ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10] [,11] ## t15 &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t12 &quot;1&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t14 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t6 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; ## t3 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## t2 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## t11 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## t7 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## t1 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;1&quot; ## t5 &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;-&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; 5.1.2 Parameters for a realistic(ish) matrix There are many parameters that can create a “realistic” matrix (i.e. not too different from the input tree with a consistency and retention index close to what is seen in the literature) but because of the randomness of the matrix generation not all parameters combination end up creating “good” matrices. The following parameters however, seem to generate fairly “realist” matrices with a starting coalescent tree, equal rates model with 0.85 binary characters and 0.15 three state characters, a gamma distribution with a shape parameter (\\(\\alpha\\)) of 10 and no scaling (\\(\\beta\\) = 1) with a rate of 50. set.seed(0) ## tree my_tree &lt;- rcoal(30) ## matrix morpho_mat &lt;- sim.morpho(tree = my_tree, characters = 100, states = c(0.85, 0.15), rates = c(rgamma, shape = 10, rate = 50), invariant = FALSE) check.morpho(morpho_mat, my_tree) ## ## Maximum parsimony 133.0000000 ## Consistency index 0.7819549 ## Retention index 0.9597222 ## Robinson-Foulds distance 4.0000000 5.2 Simulating multidimensional spaces Another way to simulate data is to directly simulate a multidimensional space with the space.maker function. This function allows users to simulate spaces with a certain number of properties. For example, it is possible to design a space with a specific distribution on each axis, a correlation between the axes and a specific cumulative variance per axis. This can be useful for creating ordinated spaces for null hypothesis, for example if you’re using the function null.test (Díaz et al. 2016). This function takes as arguments the number of elements (data points - elements argument) and dimensions (dimensions argument) to create the space and the distribution functions to be used for each axis. The distributions are passed through the distribution argument as modular functions. You can either pass a single distribution function for all the axes (for example distribution = runif for all the axis being uniform) or a specific distribution function for each specific axis (for example distribution = c(runif, rnorm, rgamma)) for the first axis being uniform, the second normal and the third gamma). You can of course use your very own functions or use the ones implemented in dispRity for more complex ones (see below). Specific optional arguments for each of these distributions can be passed as a list via the arguments argument. Furthermore, it is possible to add a correlation matrix to add a correlation between the axis via the cor.matrix argument or even a vector of proportion of variance to be bear by each axis via the scree argument to simulate realistic ordinated spaces. Here is a simple two dimensional example: ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## A square space square_space &lt;- space.maker(100, 2, runif) ## The resulting 2D matrix head(square_space) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 0.3322704 0.73741888 ## [2,] 0.5157255 0.33160759 ## [3,] 0.3716847 0.62284731 ## [4,] 0.4367013 0.76535328 ## [5,] 0.7424290 0.07764732 ## [6,] 0.0111013 0.65066885 ## Visualising the space plot(square_space, pch = 20, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, main = &quot;Uniform 2D space&quot;) Of course, more complex spaces can be created by changing the distributions, their arguments or adding a correlation matrix or a cumulative variance vector: ## A plane space: uniform with one dimensions equal to 0 plane_space &lt;- space.maker(2500, 3, c(runif, runif, runif), arguments = list(list(min = 0, max = 0), NULL, NULL)) head(plane_space) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 0 0.18294640 0.32682604 ## [2,] 0 0.67243526 0.77182827 ## [3,] 0 0.56028603 0.06603386 ## [4,] 0 0.80409259 0.19401581 ## [5,] 0 0.31732158 0.16460302 ## [6,] 0 0.09244429 0.99873117 ## Correlation matrix for a 3D space (cor_matrix &lt;- matrix(cbind(1, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8, 1, 0.7, 0.2, 0.7, 1), nrow = 3)) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.0 0.8 0.2 ## [2,] 0.8 1.0 0.7 ## [3,] 0.2 0.7 1.0 ## An ellipsoid space (normal space with correlation) ellipse_space &lt;- space.maker(2500, 3, rnorm, cor.matrix = cor_matrix) head(ellipse_space) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.5080285 -0.7014059 -1.0286500 ## [2,] 0.7250674 0.9498248 0.7220638 ## [3,] 0.4476787 0.2102857 -0.3835125 ## [4,] -1.3252827 -0.5060518 0.2211104 ## [5,] -0.9193155 -1.3861888 -1.6151720 ## [6,] -0.7217653 -0.1967257 0.2672965 ## A cylindrical space with decreasing axes variance cylindrical_space &lt;- space.maker(2500, 3, c(rnorm, rnorm, runif), scree = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1)) head(cylindrical_space) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] -0.07935545 0.10932383 0.0017309562 ## [2,] -0.20619425 -0.14809591 0.0008416656 ## [3,] -0.20133258 0.05766707 0.0041888464 ## [4,] 0.69412491 -0.47106729 0.0036967387 ## [5,] 0.41300602 0.23924098 0.0077537936 ## [6,] 0.53369953 0.02882589 0.0073476805 See below for the visualisation of the spaces. 5.2.1 Personalised dimensions distributions Following the modular architecture of the package, it is of course possible to pass home made distribution functions to the distribution argument. For example, the random.circle function is a personalised one implemented in dispRity. This function allows to create circles based on trigonometry allowing two axis to covary to produce circle coordinates. By default, this function generates two sets of coordinates with a distribution argument and a minimum and maximum boundary (inner and outer respectively) to create nice sharp edges to the circle. The maximum boundary is equivalent to the radius of the circle (it removes coordinates beyond the circle radius) and the minimum is equivalent to the radius of a smaller circle with no data (it removes coordinates below this inner circle radius). ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Generating coordinates for a normal circle with a upper boundary of 1 circle &lt;- random.circle(1000, rnorm, inner = 0, outer = 1) ## Plotting the circle plot(circle, xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;y&quot;, main = &quot;A normal circle&quot;) ## Creating doughnut space (a spherical space with a hole) doughnut_space &lt;- space.maker(5000, 3, c(rnorm, random.circle), arguments = list(list(mean = 0), list(runif, inner = 0.5, outer = 1))) head(doughnut_space) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] ## [1,] 1.0692065 -0.34286592 -0.4077478 ## [2,] 0.3898210 -0.06393936 0.5212298 ## [3,] -0.9878641 0.36223496 0.4519167 ## [4,] 0.1031183 0.08781562 0.9176893 ## [5,] 1.1351951 -0.34076407 0.8712020 ## [6,] 0.1769964 -0.77904629 0.5770467 See below for the visualisation of the “doughnut” space. 5.2.2 Visualising the space I suggest using the excellent scatterplot3d package to play around and visualise the simulated spaces: ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(mfrow = (c(2, 2)), bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Visualising 3D spaces require(scatterplot3d) ## Loading required package: scatterplot3d ## The plane space scatterplot3d(plane_space, pch = 20, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, zlab = &quot;&quot;, xlim = c(-0.5, 0.5), main = &quot;Plane space&quot;) ## The ellipsoid space scatterplot3d(ellipse_space, pch = 20, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, zlab = &quot;&quot;, main = &quot;Normal ellipsoid space&quot;) ## A cylindrical space with a decreasing variance per axis scatterplot3d(cylindrical_space, pch = 20, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, zlab = &quot;&quot;, main = &quot;Normal cylindrical space&quot;) ## Axes have different orders of magnitude ## Plotting the doughnut space scatterplot3d(doughnut_space[,c(2,1,3)], pch = 20, xlab = &quot;&quot;, ylab = &quot;&quot;, zlab = &quot;&quot;, main = &quot;Doughnut space&quot;) par(op) 5.2.3 Generating realistic spaces It is possible to generate “realistic” spaces by simply extracting the parameters of an existing space and scaling it up to the simulated space. For example, we can extract the parameters of the BeckLee_mat50 ordinated space and simulate a similar space. ## Loading the data data(BeckLee_mat50) ## Number of dimensions obs_dim &lt;- ncol(BeckLee_mat50) ## Observed correlation between the dimensions obs_correlations &lt;- cor(BeckLee_mat50) ## Observed mean and standard deviation per axis obs_mu_sd_axis &lt;- mapply(function(x,y) list(&quot;mean&quot; = x, &quot;sd&quot; = y), as.list(apply(BeckLee_mat50, 2, mean)), as.list(apply(BeckLee_mat50, 2, sd)), SIMPLIFY = FALSE) ## Observed overall mean and standard deviation obs_mu_sd_glob &lt;- list(&quot;mean&quot; = mean(BeckLee_mat50), &quot;sd&quot; = sd(BeckLee_mat50)) ## Scaled observed variance per axis (scree plot) obs_scree &lt;- variances(BeckLee_mat50)/sum(variances(BeckLee_mat50)) ## Generating our simulated space simulated_space &lt;- space.maker(1000, dimensions = obs_dim, distribution = rep(list(rnorm), obs_dim), arguments = obs_mu_sd_axis, cor.matrix = obs_correlations) ## Visualising the fit of our data in the space (in the two first dimensions) plot(simulated_space[,1:2], xlab = &quot;PC1&quot;, ylab = &quot;PC2&quot;) points(BeckLee_mat50[,1:2], col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 20) legend(&quot;topleft&quot;, legend = c(&quot;observed&quot;, &quot;simulated&quot;), pch = c(20,21), col = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;black&quot;), bg = &quot;white&quot;) It is now possible to simulate a space using these observed arguments to test several hypothesis: Is the space uniform or normal? If the space is normal, is the mean and variance global or specific for each axis? ## Measuring disparity as the sum of variance observed_disp &lt;- dispRity(BeckLee_mat50, metric = c(median, centroids)) ## Is the space uniform? test_unif &lt;- null.test(observed_disp, null.distrib = runif) ## Is the space normal with a mean of 0 and a sd of 1? test_norm1 &lt;- null.test(observed_disp, null.distrib = rnorm) ## Is the space normal with the observed mean and sd and cumulative variance test_norm2 &lt;- null.test(observed_disp, null.distrib = rep(list(rnorm), obs_dim), null.args = rep(list(obs_mu_sd_glob), obs_dim), null.scree = obs_scree) ## Is the space multiple normal with multiple means and sds and a correlation? test_norm3 &lt;- null.test(observed_disp, null.distrib = rep(list(rnorm), obs_dim), null.args = obs_mu_sd_axis, null.cor = obs_correlations) ## Graphical options op &lt;- par(mfrow = (c(2, 2)), bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the results plot(test_unif, main = &quot;Uniform (0,1)&quot;) plot(test_norm1, main = &quot;Normal (0,1)&quot;) plot(test_norm2, main = &quot;Normal (global observed\\nmean and sd)&quot;) plot(test_norm3, main = &quot;Normal (variable mean\\nand sd with correlation)&quot;) If we measure disparity as the median distance from the morphospace centroid, we can explain the distribution of the data as normal with the variable observed mean and standard deviation and with a correlation between the dimensions.

Even the simple Beck and Lee 2014 example above produces an object with &gt; 72 lines of lists of lists of matrices! Therefore dispRity uses a specific class of object called a dispRity object. These objects allow users to use S3 method functions such as summary.dispRity, plot.dispRity and print.dispRity. dispRity also contains various utility functions that manipulate the dispRity object (e.g. sort.dispRity, extract.dispRity see the full list in the next section). These functions modify the dispRity object without having to delve into its complex structure! The full structure of a dispRity object is detailed here. ## Loading the example data data(disparity) ## What is the class of the median_centroids object? class(disparity) ## [1] &quot;dispRity&quot; ## What does the object contain? names(disparity) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;call&quot; &quot;subsets&quot; &quot;disparity&quot; ## Summarising it using the S3 method print.dispRity disparity ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 7 continuous (acctran) time subsets for 99 elements with 97 dimensions: ## 90, 80, 70, 60, 50 ... ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;) and rarefied to 20, 15, 10, 5 elements. ## Disparity was calculated as: c(median, centroids).

Alternatively, of course, each elements can be accessed manually. Here is an explanation on how it works. The dispRity object is a list of two to four elements, each of which are detailed below: $matrix: an object of class matrix, the full multidimensional space. $call: an object of class list containing information on the dispRity object content. $subsets: an object of class list containing the subsets of the multidimensional space. $disparity: an object of class list containing the disparity values. The dispRity object is loosely based on C structure objects. In fact, it is composed of one unique instance of a matrix (the multidimensional space) upon which the metric function is called via “pointers” to only a certain number of elements and/or dimensions of this matrix. This allows for: (1) faster and easily tractable execution time: the metric functions are called through apply family function and can be parallelised; and (2) a really low memory footprint: at any time, only one matrix is present in the R environment rather than multiple copies of it for each subset. 6.3.1 $matrix This is the multidimensional space, stored in the R environment as a matrix object. It requires row names but not column names. By default, if the row names are missing, dispRity function will arbitrarily generate them in numeric order (i.e. rownames(matrix) &lt;- 1:nrow(matrix)). This element of the dispRity object is never modified. 6.3.2 $call This element contains the information on the dispRity object content. It is a list that can contain the following: $call$subsets: a vector of character with information on the subsets type (either &quot;continuous&quot;, &quot;discrete&quot; or &quot;custom&quot;) and their eventual model (&quot;acctran&quot;, &quot;deltran&quot;, &quot;random&quot;, &quot;proximity&quot;, &quot;equal.split&quot;, &quot;gradual.split&quot;). This element generated only once via chrono.subsets() and custom.subsets(). $call$dimensions: either a single numeric value indicating how many dimensions to use or a vector of numeric values indicating which specific dimensions to use. This element is by default the number of columns in $matrix but can be modified through boot.matrix() or dispRity(). $call$bootstrap: this is a list containing three elements: [[1]]: the number of bootstrap replicates (numeric) [[2]]: the bootstrap method (character) [[3]]: the rarefaction levels (numeric vector) $call$disparity: this is a list containing one element, $metric, that is a list containing the different functions passed to the metric argument in dispRity. These are call elements and get modified each time the dispRity function is used (the first element is the first metric(s), the second, the second metric(s), etc.). 6.3.3 $subsets This element contain the eventual subsets of the multidimensional space. It is a list of subset names. Each subset name is in turn a list of at least one element called elements which is in turn a matrix. This elements matrix is the raw (observed) elements in the subsets. The elements matrix is composed of numeric values in one column and n rows (the number of elements in the subset). Each of these values are a “pointer” (C inspired) to the element of the $matrix. For example, lets assume a dispRity object called disparity, composed of at least one subsets called sub1: disparity$subsets$sub1$elements [,1] [1,] 5 [2,] 4 [3,] 6 [4,] 7 The values in the matrix “point” to the elements in $matrix: here, the multidimensional space with only the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th elements. The following elements in diparity$subsets$sub1 will correspond to the same “pointers” but drawn from the bootstrap replicates. The columns will correspond to different bootstrap replicates. For example: disparity$subsets$sub1[[2]] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 57 43 70 4 [2,] 43 44 4 4 [3,] 42 84 44 1 [4,] 84 7 2 10 This signifies that we have four bootstrap pseudo-replicates pointing each time to four elements in $matrix. The next element ([[3]]) will be the same for the eventual first rarefaction level (i.e. the resulting bootstrap matrix will have m rows where m is the number of elements for this rarefaction level). The next element after that ([[4]]) will be the same for with an other rarefaction level and so forth… 6.3.4 $disparity The $disparity element is identical to the $subsets element structure (a list of list(s) containing matrices) but the matrices don’t contain “pointers” to $matrix but the disparity result of the disparity metric applied to the “pointers”. For example, in our first example ($elements) from above, if the disparity metric is of dimensions level 1, we would have: disparity$disparity$sub1$elements [,1] [1,] 1.82 This is the observed disparity (1.82) for the subset called sub1. If the disparity metric is of dimension level 2 (say the function range that outputs two values), we would have: disparity$disparity$sub1$elements [,1] [1,] 0.82 [2,] 2.82 The following elements in the list follow the same logic as before: rows are disparity values (one row for a dimension level 1 metric, multiple for a dimensions level 2 metric) and columns are the bootstrap replicates (the bootstrap with all elements followed by the eventual rarefaction levels). For example for the bootstrap without rarefaction (second element of the list): disparity$disparity$sub1[[2]] [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [1,] 1.744668 1.777418 1.781624 1.739679 "],

This demo showcases a typical disparity-through-time analysis: we are going to test whether the disparity changed through time in a subset of eutherian mammals from the last 100 million years using a dataset from Beck and Lee (2014). 7.1 Before starting 7.1.1 The morphospace In this example, we are going to use a subset of the data from Beck and Lee (2014). See the example data description for more details. Briefly, this dataset contains an ordinated matrix of 50 discrete characters from mammals (BeckLee_mat50), another matrix of the same 50 mammals and the estimated discrete data characters of their descendants (thus 50 + 49 rows, BeckLee_mat99), a dataframe containing the ages of each taxon in the dataset (BeckLee_ages) and finally a phylogenetic tree with the relationships among the 50 mammals (BeckLee_tree). The ordinated matrix will represent our full morphospace, i.e. all the mammalian morphologies that ever existed through time (for this dataset). ## Loading demo and the package data library(dispRity) ## Setting the random seed for repeatability set.seed(123) ## Loading the ordinated matrix/morphospace: data(BeckLee_mat50) head(BeckLee_mat50[,1:5]) ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## Cimolestes -0.5319679 0.1117759259 0.09865194 -0.1933148 0.2035833 ## Maelestes -0.4087147 0.0139690317 0.26268300 0.2297096 0.1310953 ## Batodon -0.6923194 0.3308625215 -0.10175223 -0.1899656 0.1003108 ## Bulaklestes -0.6802291 -0.0134872777 0.11018009 -0.4103588 0.4326298 ## Daulestes -0.7386111 0.0009001369 0.12006449 -0.4978191 0.4741342 ## Uchkudukodon -0.5105254 -0.2420633915 0.44170317 -0.1172972 0.3602273 dim(BeckLee_mat50) ## [1] 50 48 ## The morphospace contains 50 taxa and has 48 dimensions (or axes) ## Showing a list of first and last occurrences data for some fossils data(BeckLee_ages) head(BeckLee_ages) ## FAD LAD ## Adapis 37.2 36.8 ## Asioryctes 83.6 72.1 ## Leptictis 33.9 33.3 ## Miacis 49.0 46.7 ## Mimotona 61.6 59.2 ## Notharctus 50.2 47.0 ## Plotting a phylogeny data(BeckLee_tree) plot(BeckLee_tree, cex = 0.7) axisPhylo(root = 140) You can have an even nicer looking tree if you use the strap package! if(!require(strap)) install.packages(&quot;strap&quot;) strap::geoscalePhylo(BeckLee_tree, cex.tip = 0.7, cex.ts = 0.6) 7.2 A disparity-through-time analysis 7.2.1 Splitting the morphospace through time One of the crucial steps in disparity-through-time analysis is to split the full morphospace into smaller time subsets that contain the total number of morphologies at certain points in time (time-slicing) or during certain periods in time (time-binning). Basically, the full morphospace represents the total number of morphologies across all time and will be greater than any of the time subsets of the morphospace. The dispRity package provides a chrono.subsets function that allows users to split the morphospace into time slices (using method = continuous) or into time bins (using method = discrete). In this example, we are going to split the morphospace into five equal time bins of 20 million years long from 100 million years ago to the present. We will also provide to the function a table containing the first and last occurrences dates for some fossils to take into account that some fossils might occur in several of our different time bins. ## Creating the vector of time bins ages (time_bins &lt;- rev(seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20))) ## [1] 100 80 60 40 20 0 ## Splitting the morphospace using the chrono.subsets function (binned_morphospace &lt;- chrono.subsets(data = BeckLee_mat50, tree = BeckLee_tree, method = &quot;discrete&quot;, time = time_bins, inc.nodes = FALSE, FADLAD = BeckLee_ages)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 5 discrete time subsets for 50 elements: ## 100 - 80, 80 - 60, 60 - 40, 40 - 20, 20 - 0. The output object is a dispRity object (see more about that here. In brief, however, dispRity objects are lists of different elements (i.e. disparity results, morphospace time subsets, morphospace attributes, etc.) that display only a summary of the object when calling the object to avoiding filling the R console with superfluous output. ## Printing the class of the object class(binned_morphospace) ## [1] &quot;dispRity&quot; ## Printing the content of the object str(binned_morphospace) ## List of 3 ## $ matrix : num [1:50, 1:48] -0.532 -0.409 -0.692 -0.68 -0.739 ... ## ..- attr(*, &quot;dimnames&quot;)=List of 2 ## .. ..$ : chr [1:50] &quot;Cimolestes&quot; &quot;Maelestes&quot; &quot;Batodon&quot; &quot;Bulaklestes&quot; ... ## .. ..$ : NULL ## $ call :List of 1 ## ..$ subsets: chr &quot;discrete&quot; ## $ subsets:List of 5 ## ..$ 100 - 80:List of 1 ## .. ..$ elements: int [1:8, 1] 5 4 6 8 43 10 11 42 ## ..$ 80 - 60 :List of 1 ## .. ..$ elements: int [1:15, 1] 7 8 9 1 2 3 12 13 14 44 ... ## ..$ 60 - 40 :List of 1 ## .. ..$ elements: int [1:13, 1] 41 49 24 25 26 27 28 21 22 19 ... ## ..$ 40 - 20 :List of 1 ## .. ..$ elements: int [1:6, 1] 15 39 40 35 23 47 ## ..$ 20 - 0 :List of 1 ## .. ..$ elements: int [1:10, 1] 36 37 38 32 33 34 50 48 29 30 ## - attr(*, &quot;class&quot;)= chr &quot;dispRity&quot; names(binned_morphospace) ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; &quot;call&quot; &quot;subsets&quot; ## Printing the object as a dispRity class binned_morphospace ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 5 discrete time subsets for 50 elements: ## 100 - 80, 80 - 60, 60 - 40, 40 - 20, 20 - 0. These objects will gradual.splitly contain more information when completing the following steps in the disparity-through-time analysis. 7.2.2 Bootstrapping the data Once we obtain our different time subsets, we can bootstrap and rarefy them (i.e. pseudo-replicating the data). The bootstrapping allows us to make each subset more robust to outliers and the rarefaction allows us to compare subsets with the same number of taxa to remove sampling biases (i.e. more taxa in one subset than the others). The boot.matrix function bootstraps the dispRity object and the rarefaction option within performs rarefaction. ## Bootstrapping each time subset 100 times (default) (boot_bin_morphospace &lt;- boot.matrix(binned_morphospace)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 5 discrete time subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## 100 - 80, 80 - 60, 60 - 40, 40 - 20, 20 - 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Getting the minimum number of rows (i.e. taxa) in the time subsets min(size.subsets(boot_bin_morphospace)) ## [1] 6 ## Bootstrapping each time subset 100 times and rarefying them (rare_bin_morphospace &lt;- boot.matrix(binned_morphospace, bootstraps = 100, rarefaction = 6)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 5 discrete time subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## 100 - 80, 80 - 60, 60 - 40, 40 - 20, 20 - 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;) and rarefied to 6 elements. 7.2.3 Calculating disparity We can now calculate the disparity within each time subsets along with some confidence intervals generated by the pseudoreplication step above (bootstraps/rarefaction). Disparity can be calculated in many ways and this package allows users to come up with their own disparity metrics. For more details, please refer to the dispRity metric section. In this example, we are going to calculate the spread of the data in each time subset by calculating disparity as the sum of the variance of each dimension of the morphospace in each time subset using the dispRity function. Thus, in this example, disparity is defined by the multi-dimensional variance of each time subset (i.e. the spread of the taxa within the morphospace). Note that this metric comes with a caveat (not solved here) since it ignores covariances among the dimensions of the morphospace. We use this here because it is a standard metric used in disparity-through-time analysis (Wills, Briggs, and Fortey 1994–4AD). ## Calculating disparity for the bootstrapped data (boot_disparity &lt;- dispRity(boot_bin_morphospace, metric = c(sum, variances))) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 5 discrete time subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## 100 - 80, 80 - 60, 60 - 40, 40 - 20, 20 - 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Disparity was calculated as: c(sum, variances). ## Calculating disparity for the rarefied data (rare_disparity &lt;- dispRity(rare_bin_morphospace, metric = c(sum, variances))) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 5 discrete time subsets for 50 elements with 48 dimensions: ## 100 - 80, 80 - 60, 60 - 40, 40 - 20, 20 - 0. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;) and rarefied to 6 elements. ## Disparity was calculated as: c(sum, variances). The dispRity function does not actually display the calculated disparity values but rather only the properties of the disparity object (size, subsets, metric, etc.). To display the actual calculated scores, we need to summarise the disparity object using the S3 method summary that is applied to a dispRity object (see ?summary.dispRity for more details). As for any R package, you can refer to the help files for each individual function for more details. ## Summarising the disparity results summary(boot_disparity) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 100 - 80 8 1.675 1.488 1.087 1.389 1.568 1.648 ## 2 80 - 60 15 1.782 1.679 1.538 1.631 1.728 1.792 ## 3 60 - 40 13 1.913 1.772 1.607 1.734 1.826 1.886 ## 4 40 - 20 6 2.022 1.707 1.212 1.537 1.822 1.942 ## 5 20 - 0 10 1.971 1.794 1.598 1.716 1.842 1.890 summary(rare_disparity) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 100 - 80 8 1.675 1.484 1.194 1.400 1.547 1.636 ## 2 100 - 80 6 NA 1.477 0.993 1.361 1.569 1.698 ## 3 80 - 60 15 1.782 1.674 1.517 1.600 1.725 1.793 ## 4 80 - 60 6 NA 1.655 1.299 1.532 1.754 1.882 ## 5 60 - 40 13 1.913 1.767 1.601 1.714 1.829 1.861 ## 6 60 - 40 6 NA 1.787 1.314 1.672 1.879 1.984 ## 7 40 - 20 6 2.022 1.736 1.281 1.603 1.822 1.948 ## 8 20 - 0 10 1.971 1.807 1.595 1.729 1.856 1.917 ## 9 20 - 0 6 NA 1.790 1.435 1.718 1.873 1.995 The summary.dispRity function comes with many options on which values to calculate (central tendency and quantiles) and on how many digits to display. Refer to the function’s manual for more details. 7.2.4 Plotting the results It is sometimes easier to visualise the results in a plot than in a table. For that we can use the plot S3 function to plot the dispRity objects (see ?plot.dispRity for more details). ## Graphical options quartz(width = 10, height = 5) ; par(mfrow = (c(1,2)), bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the bootstrapped and rarefied results plot(boot_disparity, type = &quot;continuous&quot;, main = &quot;bootstrapped results&quot;) plot(rare_disparity, type = &quot;continuous&quot;, main = &quot;rarefied results&quot;) 7.3 Testing differences Finally, to draw some valid conclusions from these results, we can apply some statistical tests. We can test, for example, if mammalian disparity changed significantly through time over the last 100 million years. To do so, we can compare the means of each time-bin in a sequential manner to see whether the disparity in bin n is equal to the disparity in bin n+1, and whether this is in turn equal to the disparity in bin n+2, etc. Because our data is temporally autocorrelated (i.e. what happens in bin n+1 depends on what happened in bin n) and pseudoreplicated (i.e. each bootstrap draw creates non-independent time subsets because they are all based on the same time subsets), we apply a non-parametric mean comparison: the wilcox.test. Also, we need to apply a p-value correction (e.g. Bonferroni correction) to correct for multiple testing (see ?p.adjust for more details). ## Testing the differences between bins in the bootstrapped dataset. test.dispRity(boot_disparity, test = wilcox.test, comparison = &quot;sequential&quot;, correction = &quot;bonferroni&quot;) ## [[1]] ## statistic: W ## 100 - 80 : 80 - 60 471 ## 80 - 60 : 60 - 40 1562 ## 60 - 40 : 40 - 20 6250 ## 40 - 20 : 20 - 0 3725 ## ## [[2]] ## p.value ## 100 - 80 : 80 - 60 7.427563e-28 ## 80 - 60 : 60 - 40 1.798899e-16 ## 60 - 40 : 40 - 20 9.061511e-03 ## 40 - 20 : 20 - 0 7.379715e-03 ## Testing the differences between bins in the rarefied dataset. test.dispRity(rare_disparity, test = wilcox.test, comparison = &quot;sequential&quot;, correction = &quot;bonferroni&quot;) ## [[1]] ## statistic: W ## 100 - 80 : 80 - 60 662 ## 80 - 60 : 60 - 40 1814 ## 60 - 40 : 40 - 20 5752 ## 40 - 20 : 20 - 0 3621 ## ## [[2]] ## p.value ## 100 - 80 : 80 - 60 1.214988e-25 ## 80 - 60 : 60 - 40 2.823697e-14 ## 60 - 40 : 40 - 20 2.653018e-01 ## 40 - 20 : 20 - 0 3.026079e-03 Here our results show significant changes in disparity through time between all time bins (all p-values &lt; 0.05). However, when looking at the rarefied results, there is no significant difference between the time bins in the Palaeogene (60-40 to 40-20 Mya), suggesting that the differences detected in the first test might just be due to the differences in number of taxa sampled (13 or 6 taxa) in each time bin.

This is a pretty standard way to visualise the multidimensional space and further analysis might be necessary to test wether the groups are different such as a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). However, in this case we are ignoring the two other dimensions of the ordination! If we look at the two other axis we see a totally different result: ## Plotting the two second axis of the petal-space plot(petal_space[, 3], petal_space[, 4], col = species, xlab = paste0(&quot;PC 3 (&quot;, round(variances[3], 2), &quot;)&quot;), ylab = paste0(&quot;PC 4 (&quot;, round(variances[4], 2), &quot;)&quot;)) Additionally, these two represented dimensions do not represent a biological reality per se; i.e. the values on the first dimension do not represent a continuous trait (e.g. petal length), instead they just represent the ordinations of correlations between the data and some factors. Therefore, we might want to approach this problem without getting stuck in only two dimensions and consider the whole dataset as a n-dimensional object. 8.3 A multidimensional approach with dispRity The first step is to create different subsets that represent subsets of the ordinated space (i.e. sub-regions within the n-dimensional object). Each of these subsets will contain only the individuals of a specific species. ## Creating the table that contain the elements and their attributes petal_subsets &lt;- custom.subsets(petal_space, group = list( &quot;setosa&quot; = which(species == &quot;setosa&quot;), &quot;versicolor&quot; = which(species == &quot;versicolor&quot;), &quot;virginica&quot; = which(species == &quot;virginica&quot;))) ## Visualising the dispRity object content petal_subsets ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 customised subsets for 150 elements: ## setosa, versicolor, virginica. This created a dispRity object (more about that here) with three subsets corresponding to each subspecies. 8.3.1 Bootstrapping the data We can the bootstrap the subsets to be able test the robustness of the measured disparity to outliers. We can do that using the default options of boot.matrix (more about that here): ## Bootstrapping the data (petal_bootstrapped &lt;- boot.matrix(petal_subsets)) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 customised subsets for 150 elements with 4 dimensions: ## setosa, versicolor, virginica. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). 8.3.2 Calculating disparity Disparity can be calculated in many ways, therefore the dispRity function allows users to define their own measure of disparity. For more details on measuring disparity, see the dispRity metrics section. In this example, we are going to define disparity as the median distance between the different individuals and the centroid of the ordinated space. High values of disparity will indicate a generally high spread of points from this centroid (i.e. on average, the individuals are far apart in the ordinated space). We can define the metrics easily in the dispRity function by feeding them to the metric argument. Here we are going to feed the functions stats::median and dispRity::centroids which calculates distances between elements and their centroid. ## Calculating disparity as the median distance between each elements and ## the centroid of the petal-space (petal_disparity &lt;- dispRity(petal_bootstrapped, metric = c(median, centroids))) ## ---- dispRity object ---- ## 3 customised subsets for 150 elements with 4 dimensions: ## setosa, versicolor, virginica. ## Data was bootstrapped 100 times (method:&quot;full&quot;). ## Disparity was calculated as: c(median, centroids). 8.3.3 Summarising the results (plot) Similarly to the custom.subsets and boot.matrix function, dispRity displays a dispRity object. But we are definitely more interested in actually look at the calculated values. First we can summarise the data in a table by simply using summary: ## Displaying the summary of the calculated disparity summary(petal_disparity) ## subsets n obs bs.median 2.5% 25% 75% 97.5% ## 1 setosa 50 0.421 0.419 0.342 0.401 0.445 0.503 ## 2 versicolor 50 0.693 0.657 0.530 0.622 0.692 0.733 ## 3 virginica 50 0.785 0.745 0.577 0.690 0.797 0.880 We can also plot the results in a similar way: ## Graphical options par(bty = &quot;n&quot;) ## Plotting the disparity in the petal_space plot(petal_disparity) Now contrary to simply plotting the two first axis of the PCA where we saw that the species have a different position in the two first petal-space, we can now also see that they occupy this space clearly differently! 8.3.4 Testing hypothesis Finally we can test our hypothesis that we guessed from the disparity plot (that some groups occupy different volume of the petal-space) by using the test.dispRity option. ## Running a PERMANOVA test.dispRity(petal_disparity, test = adonis.dispRity) ## Warning in test.dispRity(petal_disparity, test = adonis.dispRity): adonis.dispRity test will be applied to the data matrix, not to the calculated disparity. ## See ?adonis.dispRity for more details. ## Warning in adonis.dispRity(data, ...): The input data for adonis.dispRity was not a distance matrix. ## The results are thus based on the distance matrix for the input data (i.e. dist(data$matrix)). ## Make sure that this is the desired methodological approach! ## ## Call: ## vegan::adonis(formula = dist(matrix) ~ group, data = data, method = &quot;euclidean&quot;) ## ## Permutation: free ## Number of permutations: 999 ## ## Terms added sequentially (first to last) ## ## Df SumsOfSqs MeanSqs F.Model R2 Pr(&gt;F) ## group 2 592.07 296.037 487.33 0.86894 0.001 *** ## Residuals 147 89.30 0.607 0.13106 ## Total 149 681.37 1.00000 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 ## Post-hoc testing of the differences between species (corrected for multiple tests) test.dispRity(petal_disparity, test = t.test, correction = &quot;bonferroni&quot;) ## [[1]] ## statistic: t ## setosa : versicolor -33.714480 ## setosa : virginica -34.257797 ## versicolor : virginica -8.595829 ## ## [[2]] ## parameter: df ## setosa : versicolor 189.0217 ## setosa : virginica 150.1371 ## versicolor : virginica 171.2387 ## ## [[3]] ## p.value ## setosa : versicolor 2.107278e-81 ## setosa : virginica 2.252270e-72 ## versicolor : virginica 1.506037e-14 We can now see that there is a significant difference in petal-space occupancy between all species of iris. 8.3.4.1 Setting up a multidimensional null-hypothesis One other series of test can be done on the shape of the petal-space. Using a MCMC permutation test we can simulate a petal-space with specific properties and see if our observed petal-space matches these properties (similarly to Díaz et al. (2016)): ## Testing against a uniform distribution disparity_uniform &lt;- null.test(petal_disparity, replicates = 200, null.distrib = runif, scale = FALSE) plot(disparity_uniform) ## Testing against a normal distribution disparity_normal &lt;- null.test(petal_disparity, replicates = 200, null.distrib = rnorm, scale = TRUE) plot(disparity_normal) In both cases we can see that our petal-space is not entirely normal or uniform. This is expected because of the simplicity of these parameters. References "],

I am working on including several “clever” bootstrap and rarefaction algorithms for palaeobiology studies based on geological sampling (following:and Butler et al. 2012 Evolution and Kotric and Knoll 2015 Palaeobiology). 9.3 Faster disparity calculations I am slowly implementing parallel disparity calculation as well as C implementations of some disparity metrics to increase significantly improve the speed of the dispRity function. 9.4 More modularity I am equally slowly developing functions to allow more of the options in the package to be modular (in the same way as the metric argument in dispRity). The next arguments to benefit this increased modularity will be chrono.subsets’s model argument and boot.matrix’s type argument. 9.5 More suggestions? More generally, I welcome any suggestions or collaborations for developing some additional specific ideas. Feel free to contact me via email (guillert@tcd.ie) or if you are a GitHub user, directly create an issue on the GitHub page. "],
